      AUTHOR&rsquo;S NOTE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of the three stories that comprise this volume[*], one, &ldquo;The Wizard,&rdquo; a
      tale of victorious faith, first appeared some years ago as a Christmas
      Annual. Another, &ldquo;Elissa,&rdquo; is an attempt, difficult enough owing to the
      scantiness of the material left to us by time, to recreate the life of the
      ancient Phoenician Zimbabwe, whose ruins still stand in Rhodesia, and,
      with the addition of the necessary love story, to suggest circumstances
      such as might have brought about or accompanied its fall at the hands of
      the surrounding savage tribes. The third, &ldquo;Black Heart and White Heart,&rdquo;
       is a story of the courtship, trials and final union of a pair of Zulu
      lovers in the time of King Cetywayo.

      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PHILIP HADDEN AND KING CETYWAYO
    </h3>
    <p>
      At the date of our introduction to him, Philip Hadden was a
      transport-rider and trader in &ldquo;the Zulu.&rdquo; Still on the right side of
      forty, in appearance he was singularly handsome; tall, dark, upright, with
      keen eyes, short-pointed beard, curling hair and clear-cut features. His
      life had been varied, and there were passages in it which he did not
      narrate even to his most intimate friends. He was of gentle birth,
      however, and it was said that he had received a public school and
      university education in England. At any rate he could quote the classics
      with aptitude on occasion, an accomplishment which, coupled with his
      refined voice and a bearing not altogether common in the wild places of
      the world, had earned for him among his rough companions the <i>soubriquet</i>
      of &ldquo;The Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However these things may have been, it is certain that he had emigrated to
      Natal under a cloud, and equally certain that his relatives at home were
      content to take no further interest in his fortunes. During the fifteen or
      sixteen years which he had spent in or about the colony, Hadden followed
      many trades, and did no good at any of them. A clever man, of agreeable
      and prepossessing manner, he always found it easy to form friendships and
      to secure a fresh start in life. But, by degrees, the friends were seized
      with a vague distrust of him; and, after a period of more or less
      application, he himself would close the opening that he had made by a
      sudden disappearance from the locality, leaving behind him a doubtful
      reputation and some bad debts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the beginning of this story of the most remarkable episodes in his
      life, Philip Hadden was engaged for several years in transport-riding&mdash;that
      is, in carrying goods on ox waggons from Durban or Maritzburg to various
      points in the interior. A difficulty such as had more than once confronted
      him in the course of his career, led to his temporary abandonment of this
      means of earning a livelihood. On arriving at the little frontier town of
      Utrecht in the Transvaal, in charge of two waggon loads of mixed goods
      consigned to a storekeeper there, it was discovered that out of six cases
      of brandy five were missing from his waggon. Hadden explained the matter
      by throwing the blame upon his Kaffir &ldquo;boys,&rdquo; but the storekeeper, a
      rough-tongued man, openly called him a thief and refused to pay the
      freight on any of the load. From words the two men came to blows, knives
      were drawn, and before anybody could interfere the storekeeper received a
      nasty wound in his side. That night, without waiting till the matter could
      be inquired into by the landdrost or magistrate, Hadden slipped away, and
      trekked back into Natal as quickly as his oxen would travel. Feeling that
      even here he was not safe, he left one of his waggons at Newcastle, loaded
      up the other with Kaffir goods&mdash;such as blankets, calico, and
      hardware&mdash;and crossed into Zululand, where in those days no sheriff&rsquo;s
      officer would be likely to follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being well acquainted with the language and customs of the natives, he did
      good trade with them, and soon found himself possessed of some cash and a
      small herd of cattle, which he received in exchange for his wares.
      Meanwhile news reached him that the man whom he had injured still vowed
      vengeance against him, and was in communication with the authorities in
      Natal. These reasons making his return to civilisation undesirable for the
      moment, and further business being impossible until he could receive a
      fresh supply of trade stuff, Hadden like a wise man turned his thoughts to
      pleasure. Sending his cattle and waggon over the border to be left in
      charge of a native headman with whom he was friendly, he went on foot to
      Ulundi to obtain permission from the king, Cetywayo, to hunt game in his
      country. Somewhat to his surprise, the Indunas or headmen, received him
      courteously&mdash;for Hadden&rsquo;s visit took place within a few months of the
      outbreak of the Zulu war in 1878, when Cetywayo was already showing
      unfriendliness to the English traders and others, though why the king did
      so they knew not.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the occasion of his first and last interview with Cetywayo, Hadden got
      a hint of the reason. It happened thus. On the second morning after his
      arrival at the royal kraal, a messenger came to inform him that &ldquo;the
      Elephant whose tread shook the earth&rdquo; had signified that it was his
      pleasure to see him. Accordingly he was led through the thousands of huts
      and across the Great Place to the little enclosure where Cetywayo, a
      royal-looking Zulu seated on a stool, and wearing a kaross of leopard
      skins, was holding an <i>indaba</i>, or conference, surrounded by his
      counsellors. The Induna who had conducted him to the august presence went
      down upon his hands and knees, and, uttering the royal salute of <i>Bayéte</i>,
      crawled forward to announce that the white man was waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him wait,&rdquo; said the king angrily; and, turning, he continued the
      discussion with his counsellors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as has been said, Hadden thoroughly understood Zulu; and, when from
      time to time the king raised his voice, some of the words he spoke reached
      his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; Cetywayo said, to a wizened and aged man who seemed to be pleading
      with him earnestly; &ldquo;am I a dog that these white hyenas should hunt me
      thus? Is not the land mine, and was it not my father&rsquo;s before me? Are not
      the people mine to save or to slay? I tell you that I will stamp out these
      little white men; my <i>impis</i> shall eat them up. I have said!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the withered aged man interposed, evidently in the character of a
      peacemaker. Hadden could not hear his talk, but he rose and pointed
      towards the sea, while from his expressive gestures and sorrowful mien, he
      seemed to be prophesying disaster should a certain course of action be
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while the king listened to him, then he sprang from his seat, his
      eyes literally ablaze with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hearken,&rdquo; he cried to the counsellor; &ldquo;I have guessed it for long, and
      now I am sure of it. You are a traitor. You are Sompseu&rsquo;s[*] dog, and the
      dog of the Natal Government, and I will not keep another man&rsquo;s dog to bite
      me in my own house. Take him away!&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [*] Sir Theophilus Shepstone&rsquo;s.
</pre>
    <p>
      A slight involuntary murmur rose from the ring of <i>indunas</i>, but the
      old man never flinched, not even when the soldiers, who presently would
      murder him, came and seized him roughly. For a few seconds, perhaps five,
      he covered his face with the corner of the kaross he wore, then he looked
      up and spoke to the king in a clear voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O King,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am a very old man; as a youth I served under Chaka
      the Lion, and I heard his dying prophecy of the coming of the white man.
      Then the white men came, and I fought for Dingaan at the battle of the
      Blood River. They slew Dingaan, and for many years I was the counsellor of
      Panda, your father. I stood by you, O King, at the battle of the Tugela,
      when its grey waters were turned to red with the blood of Umbulazi your
      brother, and of the tens of thousands of his people. Afterwards I became
      your counsellor, O King, and I was with you when Sompseu set the crown
      upon your head and you made promises to Sompseu&mdash;promises that you
      have not kept. Now you are weary of me, and it is well; for I am very old,
      and doubtless my talk is foolish, as it chances to the old. Yet I think
      that the prophecy of Chaka, your great-uncle, will come true, and that the
      white men will prevail against you and that through them you shall find
      your death. I would that I might have stood in one more battle and fought
      for you, O King, since fight you will, but the end which you choose is for
      me the best end. Sleep in peace, O King, and farewell. <i>Bayéte!</i>&rdquo;[*]
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [*] The royal salute of the Zulus.
</pre>
    <p>
      For a space there was silence, a silence of expectation while men waited
      to hear the tyrant reverse his judgment. But it did not please him to be
      merciful, or the needs of policy outweighed his pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him away,&rdquo; he repeated. Then, with a slow smile on his face and one
      word, &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; upon his lips, supported by the arm of a soldier, the
      old warrior and statesman shuffled forth to the place of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadden watched and listened in amazement not unmixed with fear. &ldquo;If he
      treats his own servants like this, what will happen to me?&rdquo; he reflected.
      &ldquo;We English must have fallen out of favour since I left Natal. I wonder
      whether he means to make war on us or what? If so, this isn&rsquo;t my place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the king, who had been gazing moodily at the ground, chanced to
      look up. &ldquo;Bring the stranger here,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadden heard him, and coming forward offered Cetywayo his hand in as cool
      and nonchalant a manner as he could command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat to his surprise it was accepted. &ldquo;At least, White Man,&rdquo; said the
      king, glancing at his visitor&rsquo;s tall spare form and cleanly cut face, &ldquo;you
      are no &lsquo;<i>umfagozan</i>&rsquo; (low fellow); you are of the blood of chiefs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, King,&rdquo; answered Hadden, with a little sigh, &ldquo;I am of the blood of
      chiefs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want in my country, White Man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very little, King. I have been trading here, as I daresay you have heard,
      and have sold all my goods. Now I ask your leave to hunt buffalo, and
      other big game, for a while before I return to Natal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot grant it,&rdquo; answered Cetywayo, &ldquo;you are a spy sent by Sompseu, or
      by the Queen&rsquo;s Induna in Natal. Get you gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Hadden, with a shrug of his shoulders; &ldquo;then I hope that
      Sompseu, or the Queen&rsquo;s Induna, or both of them, will pay me when I return
      to my own country. Meanwhile I will obey you because I must, but I should
      first like to make you a present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What present?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;I want no presents. We are rich here,
      White Man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it, King. It was nothing worthy of your taking, only a rifle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rifle, White Man? Where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without. I would have brought it, but your servants told me that it is
      death to come armed before the &lsquo;Elephant who shakes the Earth.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cetywayo frowned, for the note of sarcasm did not escape his quick ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let this white man&rsquo;s offering be brought; I will consider the thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the Induna who had accompanied Hadden darted to the gateway,
      running with his body bent so low that it seemed as though at every step
      he must fall upon his face. Presently he returned with the weapon in his
      hand and presented it to the king, holding it so that the muzzle was
      pointed straight at the royal breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I crave leave to say, O Elephant,&rdquo; remarked Hadden in a drawling voice,
      &ldquo;that it might be well to command your servant to lift the mouth of that
      gun from your heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only because it is loaded, and at full cock, O Elephant, who probably
      desires to continue to shake the Earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words the &ldquo;Elephant&rdquo; uttered a sharp exclamation, and rolled from
      his stool in a most unkingly manner, whilst the terrified Induna,
      springing backwards, contrived to touch the trigger of the rifle and
      discharge a bullet through the exact spot that a second before had been
      occupied by his monarch&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him be taken away,&rdquo; shouted the incensed king from the ground, but
      long before the words had passed his lips the Induna, with a cry that the
      gun was bewitched, had cast it down and fled at full speed through the
      gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has already taken himself away,&rdquo; suggested Hadden, while the audience
      tittered. &ldquo;No, King, do not touch it rashly; it is a repeating rifle. Look&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       and lifting the Winchester, he fired the four remaining shots in quick
      succession into the air, striking the top of a tree at which he aimed with
      every one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Wow</i>, it is wonderful!&rdquo; said the company in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the thing finished?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the present it has,&rdquo; answered Hadden. &ldquo;Look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cetywayo took the repeater in his hand, and examined it with caution,
      swinging the muzzle horizontally in an exact line with the stomachs of
      some of his most eminent Indunas, who shrank to this side and that as the
      barrel was brought to bear on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what cowards they are, White Man,&rdquo; said the king with indignation;
      &ldquo;they fear lest there should be another bullet in this gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Hadden, &ldquo;they are cowards indeed. I believe that if they
      were seated on stools they would tumble off them just as it chanced to
      your Majesty to do just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand the making of guns, White Man?&rdquo; asked the king hastily,
      while the Indunas one and all turned their heads, and contemplated the
      fence behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, King, I cannot make guns, but I can mend them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I paid you well, White Man, would you stop here at my kraal, and mend
      guns for me?&rdquo; asked Cetywayo anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might depend on the pay,&rdquo; answered Hadden; &ldquo;but for awhile I am tired
      of work, and wish to rest. If the king gives me the permission to hunt for
      which I asked, and men to go with me, then when I return perhaps we can
      bargain on the matter. If not, I will bid the king farewell, and journey
      to Natal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order to make report of what he has seen and learned here,&rdquo; muttered
      Cetywayo.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the talk was interrupted, for the soldiers who had led away
      the old Induna returned at speed, and prostrated themselves before the
      king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has travelled the king&rsquo;s bridge,&rdquo; they answered grimly; &ldquo;he died
      singing a song of praise of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Cetywayo, &ldquo;that stone shall hurt my feet no more. Go, tell
      the tale of its casting away to Sompseu and to the Queen&rsquo;s Induna in
      Natal,&rdquo; he added with bitter emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Baba!</i> Hear our Father speak. Listen to the rumbling of the
      Elephant,&rdquo; said the Indunas taking the point, while one bolder than the
      rest added: &ldquo;Soon we will tell them another tale, the white Talking Ones,
      a red tale, a tale of spears, and the regiments shall sing it in their
      ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the words an enthusiasm caught hold of the listeners, as the sudden
      flame catches hold of dry grass. They sprang up, for the most of them were
      seated on their haunches, and stamping their feet upon the ground in
      unison, repeated:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Indaba ibomwu&mdash;indaba ye mikonto
     Lizo dunyiswa nge impi ndhlebeni yaho.</i>
     (A red tale! A red tale! A tale of spears,
     And the <i>impis</i> shall sing it in their ears.)
</pre>
    <p>
      One of them, indeed, a great fierce-faced fellow, drew near to Hadden and
      shaking his fist before his eyes&mdash;fortunately being in the royal
      presence he had no assegai&mdash;shouted the sentences at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king saw that the fire he had lit was burning too fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence,&rdquo; he thundered in the deep voice for which he was remarkable, and
      instantly each man became as if he were turned to stone, only the echoes
      still answered back: &ldquo;And the <i>impis</i> shall sing it in their ears&mdash;in
      their ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am growing certain that this is no place for me,&rdquo; thought Hadden; &ldquo;if
      that scoundrel had been armed he might have temporarily forgotten himself.
      Hullo! who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then there appeared through the gate of the fence a splendid specimen
      of the Zulu race. The man, who was about thirty-five years of age, was
      arrayed in a full war dress of a captain of the Umcityu regiment. From the
      circlet of otter skin on his brow rose his crest of plumes, round his
      middle, arms and knees hung the long fringes of black oxtails, and in one
      hand he bore a little dancing shield, also black in colour. The other was
      empty, since he might not appear before the king bearing arms. In
      countenance the man was handsome, and though just now they betrayed some
      anxiety, his eyes were genial and honest, and his mouth sensitive. In
      height he must have measured six foot two inches, yet he did not strike
      the observer as being tall, perhaps because of his width of chest and the
      solidity of his limbs, that were in curious contrast to the delicate and
      almost womanish hands and feet which so often mark the Zulu of noble
      blood. In short the man was what he seemed to be, a savage gentleman of
      birth, dignity and courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In company with him was another man plainly dressed in a moocha and a
      blanket, whose grizzled hair showed him to be over fifty years of age. His
      face also was pleasant and even refined, but the eyes were timorous, and
      the mouth lacked character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are these?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men fell on their knees before him, and bowed till their foreheads
      touched the ground&mdash;the while giving him his <i>sibonga</i> or titles
      of praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; he said impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O King,&rdquo; said the young warrior, seating himself Zulu fashion, &ldquo;I am
      Nahoon, the son of Zomba, a captain of the Umcityu, and this is my uncle
      Umgona, the brother of one of my mothers, my father&rsquo;s youngest wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cetywayo frowned. &ldquo;What do you here away from your regiment, Nahoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May it please the king, I have leave of absence from the head captains,
      and I come to ask a boon of the king&rsquo;s bounty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be swift, then, Nahoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is this, O King,&rdquo; said the captain with some embarrassment: &ldquo;A while
      ago the king was pleased to make a <i>keshla</i> of me because of certain
      service that I did out yonder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he touched the black ring
      which he wore in the hair of his head. &ldquo;Being now a ringed man and a
      captain, I crave the right of a man at the hands of the king&mdash;the
      right to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right? Speak more humbly, son of Zomba; my soldiers and my cattle have no
      rights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nahoon bit his lip, for he had made a serious mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, O King. The matter stands thus: My uncle Umgona here has a fair
      daughter named Nanea, whom I desire to wife, and who desires me to
      husband. Awaiting the king&rsquo;s leave I am betrothed to her and in earnest of
      it I have paid to Umgona a <i>lobola</i> of fifteen head of cattle, cows
      and calves together. But Umgona has a powerful neighbour, an old chief
      named Maputa, the warden of the Crocodile Drift, who doubtless is known to
      the king, and this chief also seeks Nanea in marriage and harries Umgona,
      threatening him with many evils if he will not give the girl to him. But
      Umgona&rsquo;s heart is white towards me, and towards Maputa it is black,
      therefore together we come to crave this boon of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so; he speaks the truth,&rdquo; said Umgona.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cease,&rdquo; answered Cetywayo angrily. &ldquo;Is this a time that my soldiers
      should seek wives in marriage, wives to turn their hearts to water? Know
      that but yesterday for this crime I commanded that twenty girls who had
      dared without my leave to marry men of the Undi regiment, should be
      strangled and their bodies laid upon the cross-roads and with them the
      bodies of their fathers, that all might know their sin and be warned
      thereby. Ay, Umgona, it is well for you and for your daughter that you
      sought my word before she was given in marriage to this man. Now this is
      my award: I refuse your prayer, Nahoon, and since you, Umgona, are
      troubled with one whom you would not take as son-in-law, the old chief
      Maputa, I will free you from his importunity. The girl, says Nahoon, is
      fair&mdash;good, I myself will be gracious to her, and she shall be
      numbered among the wives of the royal house. Within thirty days from now,
      in the week of the next new moon, let her be delivered to the <i>Sigodhla</i>,
      the royal house of the women, and with her those cattle, the cows and the
      calves together, that Nahoon has given you, of which I fine him because he
      has dared to think of marriage without the leave of the king.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE BEE PROPHESIES
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A Daniel come to judgment&rsquo; indeed,&rdquo; reflected Hadden, who had been
      watching this savage comedy with interest; &ldquo;our love-sick friend has got
      more than he bargained for. Well, that comes of appealing to Cæsar,&rdquo; and
      he turned to look at the two suppliants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man, Umgona, merely started, then began to pour out sentences of
      conventional thanks and praise to the king for his goodness and
      condescension. Cetywayo listened to his talk in silence, and when he had
      done answered by reminding him tersely that if Nanea did not appear at the
      date named, both she and he, her father, would in due course certainly
      decorate a cross-road in their own immediate neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain, Nahoon, afforded a more curious study. As the fatal words
      crossed the king&rsquo;s lips, his face took an expression of absolute
      astonishment, which was presently replaced by one of fury&mdash;the just
      fury of a man who suddenly has suffered an unutterable wrong. His whole
      frame quivered, the veins stood out in knots on his neck and forehead, and
      his fingers closed convulsively as though they were grasping the handle of
      a spear. Presently the rage passed away&mdash;for as well might a man be
      wroth with fate as with a Zulu despot&mdash;to be succeeded by a look of
      the most hopeless misery. The proud dark eyes grew dull, the
      copper-coloured face sank in and turned ashen, the mouth drooped, and down
      one corner of it there trickled a little line of blood springing from the
      lip bitten through in the effort to keep silence. Lifting his hand in
      salute to the king, the great man rose and staggered rather than walked
      towards the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he reached it, the voice of Cetywayo commanded him to stop. &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;I have a service for you, Nahoon, that shall drive out of your head
      these thoughts of wives and marriage. You see this white man here; he is
      my guest, and would hunt buffalo and big game in the bush country. I put
      him in your charge; take men with you, and see that he comes to no hurt.
      So also that you bring him before me within a month, or your life shall
      answer for it. Let him be here at my royal kraal in the first week of the
      new moon&mdash;when Nanea comes&mdash;and then I will tell you whether or
      no I agree with you that she is fair. Go now, my child, and you, White
      Man, go also; those who are to accompany you shall be with you at the
      dawn. Farewell, but remember we meet again at the new moon, when we will
      settle what pay you shall receive as keeper of my guns. Do not fail me,
      White Man, or I shall send after you, and my messengers are sometimes
      rough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This means that I am a prisoner,&rdquo; thought Hadden, &ldquo;but it will go hard if
      I cannot manage to give them the slip somehow. I don&rsquo;t intend to stay in
      this country if war is declared, to be pounded into <i>mouti</i>
      (medicine), or have my eyes put out, or any little joke of that sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Ten days had passed, and one evening Hadden and his escort were encamped
      in a wild stretch of mountainous country lying between the Blood and
      Unvunyana Rivers, not more than eight miles from that &ldquo;Place of the Little
      Hand&rdquo; which within a few weeks was to become famous throughout the world
      by its native name of Isandhlwana. For three days they had been tracking
      the spoor of a small herd of buffalo that still inhabited the district,
      but as yet they had not come up with them. The Zulu hunters had suggested
      that they should follow the Unvunyana down towards the sea where game was
      more plentiful, but this neither Hadden, nor the captain, Nahoon, had been
      anxious to do, for reasons which each of them kept secret to himself.
      Hadden&rsquo;s object was to work gradually down to the Buffalo River across
      which he hoped to effect a retreat into Natal. That of Nahoon was to
      linger in the neighbourhood of the kraal of Umgona, which was situated not
      very far from their present camping place, in the vague hope that he might
      find an opportunity of speaking with or at least of seeing Nanea, the girl
      to whom he was affianced, who within a few weeks must be taken from him,
      and given over to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more eerie-looking spot than that where they were encamped Hadden had
      never seen. Behind them lay a tract of land&mdash;half-swamp and half-bush&mdash;in
      which the buffalo were supposed to be hiding. Beyond, in lonely grandeur,
      rose the mountain of Isandhlwana, while in front was an amphitheatre of
      the most gloomy forest, ringed round in the distance by sheer-sided hills.
      Into this forest there ran a river which drained the swamp, placidly
      enough upon the level. But it was not always level, for within three
      hundred yards of them it dashed suddenly over a precipice, of no great
      height but very steep, falling into a boiling rock-bound pool that the
      light of the sun never seemed to reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the name of that forest, Nahoon?&rdquo; asked Hadden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is named <i>Emagudu</i>, The Home of the Dead,&rdquo; the Zulu replied
      absently, for he was looking towards the kraal of Nanea, which was
      situated at an hour&rsquo;s walk away over the ridge to the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Home of the Dead! Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the dead live there, those whom we name the <i>Esemkofu</i>, the
      Speechless Ones, and with them other Spirits, the <i>Amahlosi</i>, from
      whom the breath of life has passed away, and who yet live on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Hadden, &ldquo;and have you ever seen these ghosts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I mad that I should go to look for them, White Man? Only the dead
      enter that forest, and it is on the borders of it that our people make
      offerings to the dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Followed by Nahoon, Hadden walked to the edge of the cliff and looked over
      it. To the left lay the deep and dreadful-looking pool, while close to the
      bank of it, placed upon a narrow strip of turf between the cliff and the
      commencement of the forest, was a hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who lives there?&rdquo; asked Hadden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great <i>Isanusi</i>&mdash;she who is named <i>Inyanga</i> or
      Doctoress; she who is named Inyosi (the Bee), because she gathers wisdom
      from the dead who grow in the forest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think that she could gather enough wisdom to tell me whether I am
      going to kill any buffalo, Nahoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mayhap, White Man, but,&rdquo; he added with a little smile, &ldquo;those who visit
      the Bee&rsquo;s hive may hear nothing, or they may hear more than they wish for.
      The words of that Bee have a sting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good; I will see if she can sting me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said Nahoon; and turning, he led the way along the cliff till
      he reached a native path which zig-zagged down its face.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this path they climbed till they came to the sward at the foot of the
      descent, and walked up it to the hut which was surrounded by a low fence
      of reeds, enclosing a small court-yard paved with ant-heap earth beaten
      hard and polished. In this court-yard sat the Bee, her stool being placed
      almost at the mouth of the round opening that served as a doorway to the
      hut. At first all that Hadden could see of her, crouched as she was in the
      shadow, was a huddled shape wrapped round with a greasy and tattered
      catskin kaross, above the edge of which appeared two eyes, fierce and
      quick as those of a leopard. At her feet smouldered a little fire, and
      ranged around it in a semi-circle were a number of human skulls, placed in
      pairs as though they were talking together, whilst other bones, to all
      appearance also human, were festooned about the hut and the fence of the
      courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that the old lady is set up with the usual properties,&rdquo; thought
      Hadden, but he said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did the witch-doctoress say anything; she only fixed her beady eyes
      upon his face. Hadden returned the compliment, staring at her with all his
      might, till suddenly he became aware that he was vanquished in this
      curious duel. His brain grew confused, and to his fancy it seemed that the
      woman before him had shifted shape into the likeness of colossal and
      horrid spider sitting at the mouth of her trap, and that these bones were
      the relics of her victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not speak, White Man?&rdquo; she said at last in a slow clear voice.
      &ldquo;Well, there is no need, since I can read your thoughts. You are thinking
      that I who am called the Bee should be better named the Spider. Have no
      fear; I did not kill these men. What would it profit me when the dead are
      so many? I suck the souls of men, not their bodies, White Man. It is their
      living hearts I love to look on, for therein I read much and thereby I
      grow wise. Now what would you of the Bee, White Man, the Bee that labours
      in this Garden of Death, and&mdash;what brings <i>you</i> here, son of
      Zomba? Why are you not with the Umcityu now that they doctor themselves
      for the great war&mdash;the last war&mdash;the war of the white and the
      black&mdash;or if you have no stomach for fighting, why are you not at the
      side of Nanea the tall, Nanea the fair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nahoon made no answer, but Hadden said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A small thing, mother. I would know if I shall prosper in my hunting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In your hunting, White Man; what hunting? The hunting of game, of money,
      or of women? Well, one of them, for a-hunting you must ever be; that is
      your nature, to hunt and be hunted. Tell me now, how goes the wound of
      that trader who tasted of your steel yonder in the town of the Maboon
      (Boers)? No need to answer, White Man, but what fee, Chief, for the poor
      witch-doctoress whose skill you seek,&rdquo; she added in a whining voice.
      &ldquo;Surely you would not that an old woman should work without a fee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have none to offer you, mother, so I will be going,&rdquo; said Hadden, who
      began to feel himself satisfied with this display of the Bee&rsquo;s powers of
      observation and thought-reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she answered with an unpleasant laugh, &ldquo;would you ask a question,
      and not wait for the answer? I will take no fee from you at present, White
      Man; you shall pay me later on when we meet again,&rdquo; and once more she
      laughed. &ldquo;Let me look in your face, let me look in your face,&rdquo; she
      continued, rising and standing before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then of a sudden Hadden felt something cold at the back of his neck, and
      the next instant the Bee had sprung from him, holding between her thumb
      and finger a curl of dark hair which she had cut from his head. The action
      was so instantaneous that he had neither time to avoid nor to resent it,
      but stood still staring at her stupidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all I need,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;for like my heart my magic is white.
      Stay&mdash;son of Zomba, give me also of your hair, for those who visit
      the Bee must listen to her humming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nahoon obeyed, cutting a little lock from his head with the sharp edge of
      his assegai, though it was very evident that he did this not because he
      wished to do so, but because he feared to refuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Bee slipped back her kaross, and stood bending over the fire
      before them, into which she threw herbs taken from a pouch that was bound
      about her middle. She was still a finely-shaped woman, and she wore none
      of the abominations which Hadden had been accustomed to see upon the
      persons of witch-doctoresses. About her neck, however, was a curious
      ornament, a small live snake, red and grey in hue, which her visitors
      recognised as one of the most deadly to be found in that part of the
      country. It is not unusual for Bantu witch-doctors thus to decorate
      themselves with snakes, though whether or not their fangs have first been
      extracted no one seems to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the herbs began to smoulder, and the smoke of them rose up in a
      thin, straight stream, that, striking upon the face of the Bee, clung
      about her head enveloping it as though with a strange blue veil. Then of a
      sudden she stretched out her hands, and let fall the two locks of hair
      upon the burning herbs, where they writhed themselves to ashes like things
      alive. Next she opened her mouth, and began to draw the fumes of the hair
      and herbs into her lungs in great gulps; while the snake, feeling the
      influence of the medicine, hissed and, uncoiling itself from about her
      neck, crept upwards and took refuge among the black <i>saccaboola</i>
      feathers of her head-dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the vapours began to do their work; she swayed to and fro muttering,
      then sank back against the hut, upon the straw of which her head rested.
      Now the Bee&rsquo;s face was turned upwards towards the light, and it was
      ghastly to behold, for it had become blue in colour, and the open eyes
      were sunken like the eyes of one dead, whilst above her forehead the red
      snake wavered and hissed, reminding Hadden of the Uraeus crest on the brow
      of statues of Egyptian kings. For ten seconds or more she remained thus,
      then she spoke in a hollow and unnatural voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Black Heart and body that is white and beautiful, I look into your
      heart, and it is black as blood, and it shall be black with blood.
      Beautiful white body with black heart, you shall find your game and hunt
      it, and it shall lead you into the House of the Homeless, into the Home of
      the Dead, and it shall be shaped as a bull, it shall be shaped as a tiger,
      it shall be shaped as a woman whom kings and waters cannot harm. Beautiful
      white body and black heart, you shall be paid your wages, money for money,
      and blow for blow. Think of my word when the spotted cat purrs above your
      breast; think of it when the battle roars about you; think of it when you
      grasp your great reward, and for the last time stand face to face with the
      ghost of the dead in the Home of the Dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O White Heart and black body, I look into your heart and it is white as
      milk, and the milk of innocence shall save it. Fool, why do you strike
      that blow? Let him be who is loved of the tiger, and whose love is as the
      love of a tiger. Ah! what face is that in the battle? Follow it, follow
      it, O swift of foot; but follow warily, for the tongue that has lied will
      never plead for mercy, and the hand that can betray is strong in war.
      White Heart, what is death? In death life lives, and among the dead you
      shall find the life you lost, for there awaits you she whom kings and
      waters cannot harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the Bee spoke, by degrees her voice sank lower and lower till it was
      almost inaudible. Then it ceased altogether and she seemed to pass from
      trance to sleep. Hadden, who had been listening to her with an amused and
      cynical smile, now laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you laugh, White Man?&rdquo; asked Nahoon angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I laugh at my own folly in wasting time listening to the nonsense of that
      lying fraud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no nonsense, White Man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? Then will you tell me what it means?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you what it means yet, but her words have to do with a
      woman and a leopard, and with your fate and my fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hadden shrugged his shoulders, not thinking the matter worth further
      argument, and at that moment the Bee woke up shivering, drew the red snake
      from her head-dress and coiling it about her throat wrapped herself again
      in the greasy kaross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you satisfied with my wisdom, <i>Inkoos</i>?&rdquo; she asked of Hadden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am satisfied that you are one of the cleverest cheats in Zululand,
      mother,&rdquo; he answered coolly. &ldquo;Now, what is there to pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bee took no offence at this rude speech, though for a second or two
      the look in her eyes grew strangely like that which they had seen in those
      of the snake when the fumes of the fire made it angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the white lord says I am a cheat, it must be so,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;for
      he of all men should be able to discern a cheat. I have said that I ask no
      fee;&mdash;yes, give me a little tobacco from your pouch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hadden opened the bag of antelope hide and drawing some tobacco from it,
      gave it to her. In taking it she clasped his hand and examined the gold
      ring that was upon the third finger, a ring fashioned like a snake with
      two little rubies set in the head to represent the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wear a snake about my neck, and you wear one upon your hand, <i>Inkoos</i>.
      I should like to have this ring to wear upon my hand, so that the snake
      about my neck may be less lonely there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I am afraid you will have to wait till I am dead,&rdquo; said Hadden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; she answered in a pleased voice, &ldquo;it is a good word. I will
      wait till you are dead and then I will take the ring, and none can say
      that I have stolen it, for Nahoon there will bear me witness that you gave
      me permission to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time Hadden started, since there was something about the
      Bee&rsquo;s tone that jarred upon him. Had she addressed him in her professional
      manner, he would have thought nothing of it; but in her cupidity she had
      become natural, and it was evident that she spoke from conviction,
      believing her own words.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw him start, and instantly changed her note.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the white lord forgive the jest of a poor old witch-doctoress,&rdquo; she
      said in a whining voice. &ldquo;I have so much to do with Death that his name
      leaps to my lips,&rdquo; and she glanced first at the circle of skulls about
      her, then towards the waterfall that fed the gloomy pool upon whose banks
      her hut was placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the line of her outstretched hand Hadden&rsquo;s eyes fell upon two
      withered mimosa trees which grew over the fall almost at right angles to
      its rocky edge. These trees were joined together by a rude platform made
      of logs of wood lashed down with <i>riems</i> of hide. Upon this platform
      stood three figures; notwithstanding the distance and the spray of the
      fall, he could see that they were those of two men and a girl, for their
      shapes stood out distinctly against the fiery red of the sunset sky. One
      instant there were three, the next there were two&mdash;for the girl had
      gone, and something dark rushing down the face of the fall, struck the
      surface of the pool with a heavy thud, while a faint and piteous cry broke
      upon his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of that?&rdquo; he asked, horrified and amazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered the Bee with a laugh. &ldquo;Do you not know, then, that
      this is the place where faithless women, or girls who have loved without
      the leave of the king, are brought to meet their death, and with them
      their accomplices. Oh! they die here thus each day, and I watch them die
      and keep the count of the number of them,&rdquo; and drawing a tally-stick from
      the thatch of the hut, she took a knife and added a notch to the many that
      appeared upon it, looking at Nahoon the while with a half-questioning,
      half-warning gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, it is a place of death,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;Up yonder the quick die
      day by day and down there&rdquo;&mdash;and she pointed along the course of the
      river beyond the pool to where the forest began some two hundred yards
      from her hut&mdash;&ldquo;the ghosts of them have their home. Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, a sound reached their ears that seemed to swell from the dim
      skirts of the forests, a peculiar and unholy sound which it is impossible
      to define more accurately than by saying that it seemed beastlike, and
      almost inarticulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; repeated the Bee, &ldquo;they are merry yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Hadden; &ldquo;the baboons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, <i>Inkoos</i>, the <i>Amatongo</i>&mdash;the ghosts that welcome her
      who has just become of their number.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ghosts,&rdquo; said Hadden roughly, for he was angry at his own tremors, &ldquo;I
      should like to see those ghosts. Do you think that I have never heard a
      troop of monkeys in the bush before, mother? Come, Nahoon, let us be going
      while there is light to climb the cliff. Farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell <i>Inkoos</i>, and doubt not that your wish will be fulfilled.
      Go in peace <i>Inkoos</i>&mdash;to sleep in peace.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE END OF THE HUNT
    </h3>
    <p>
      The prayer of the Bee notwithstanding, Philip Hadden slept ill that night.
      He felt in the best of health, and his conscience was not troubling him
      more than usual, but rest he could not. Whenever he closed his eyes, his
      mind conjured up a picture of the grim witch-doctoress, so strangely named
      the Bee, and the sound of her evil-omened words as he had heard them that
      afternoon. He was neither a superstitious nor a timid man, and any
      supernatural beliefs that might linger in his mind were, to say the least
      of it, dormant. But do what he might, he could not shake off a certain
      eerie sensation of fear, lest there should be some grains of truth in the
      prophesyings of this hag. What if it were a fact that he was near his
      death, and that the heart which beat so strongly in his breast must soon
      be still for ever&mdash;no, he would not think of it. This gloomy place,
      and the dreadful sight which he saw that day, had upset his nerves. The
      domestic customs of these Zulus were not pleasant, and for his part he was
      determined to be clear of them so soon as he was able to escape the
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, if he could in any way manage it, it was his intention to make a
      dash for the border on the following night. To do this with a good
      prospect of success, however, it was necessary that he should kill a
      buffalo, or some other head of game. Then, as he knew well, the hunters
      with him would feast upon meat until they could scarcely stir, and that
      would be his opportunity. Nahoon, however, might not succumb to this
      temptation; therefore he must trust to luck to be rid of him. If it came
      to the worst, he could put a bullet through him, which he considered he
      would be justified in doing, seeing that in reality the man was his
      jailor. Should this necessity arise, he felt indeed that he could face it
      without undue compunction, for in truth he disliked Nahoon; at times he
      even hated him. Their natures were antagonistic, and he knew that the
      great Zulu distrusted and looked down upon him, and to be looked down upon
      by a savage &ldquo;nigger&rdquo; was more than his pride could stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first break of dawn Hadden rose and roused his escort, who were
      still stretched in sleep around the dying fire, each man wrapped in his
      kaross or blanket. Nahoon stood up and shook himself, looking gigantic in
      the shadows of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your will, <i>Umlungu</i> (white man), that you are up before the
      sun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My will, <i>Muntumpofu</i> (yellow man), is to hunt buffalo,&rdquo; answered
      Hadden coolly. It irritated him that this savage should give him no title
      of any sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon,&rdquo; said the Zulu reading his thoughts, &ldquo;but I cannot call you
      <i>Inkoos</i> because you are not my chief, or any man&rsquo;s; still if the
      title &lsquo;white man&rsquo; offends you, we will give you a name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you wish,&rdquo; answered Hadden briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly they gave him a name, <i>Inhlizin-mgama</i>, by which he was
      known among them thereafter, but Hadden was not best pleased when he found
      that the meaning of those soft-sounding syllables was &ldquo;Black Heart.&rdquo; That
      was how the <i>inyanga</i> had addressed him&mdash;only she used different
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, and they were in the swampy bush country that lay behind
      the encampment searching for their game. Within a very little while Nahoon
      held up his hand, then pointed to the ground. Hadden looked; there,
      pressed deep in the marshy soil, and to all appearance not ten minutes
      old, was the spoor of a small herd of buffalo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that we should find game to-day,&rdquo; whispered Nahoon, &ldquo;because the
      Bee said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse the Bee,&rdquo; answered Hadden below his breath. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a quarter of an hour or more they followed the spoor through thick
      reeds, till suddenly Nahoon whistled very softly and touched Hadden&rsquo;s arm.
      He looked up, and there, about two hundred yards away, feeding on some
      higher ground among a patch if mimosa trees, were the buffaloes&mdash;six
      of them&mdash;an old bull with a splendid head, three cows, a heifer and a
      calf about four months old. Neither the wind nor the nature of the veldt
      were favourable for them to stalk the game from their present position, so
      they made a detour of half a mile and very carefully crept towards them up
      the wind, slipping from trunk to trunk of the mimosas and when these
      failed them, crawling on their stomachs under cover of the tall <i>tambuti</i>
      grass. At last they were within forty yards, and a further advance seemed
      impracticable; for although he could not smell them, it was evident from
      his movements that the old bull heard some unusual sound and was growing
      suspicious. Nearest to Hadden, who alone of the party had a rifle, stood
      the heifer broadside on&mdash;a beautiful shot. Remembering that she would
      make the best beef, he lifted his Martini, and aiming at her immediately
      behind the shoulder, gently squeezed the trigger. The rifle exploded, and
      the heifer fell dead, shot through the heart. Strangely enough the other
      buffaloes did not at once run away. On the contrary, they seemed puzzled
      to account for the sudden noise; and, not being able to wind anything,
      lifted their heads and stared round them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pause gave Hadden space to get in a fresh cartridge and to aim again,
      this time at the old bull. The bullet struck him somewhere in the neck or
      shoulder, for he came to his knees, but in another second was up and
      having caught sight of the cloud of smoke he charged straight at it.
      Because of this smoke, or for some other reason, Hadden did not see him
      coming, and in consequence would most certainly have been trampled or
      gored, had not Nahoon sprung forward, at the imminent risk of his own
      life, and dragged him down behind an ant-heap. A moment more and the great
      beast had thundered by, taking no further notice of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forward,&rdquo; said Hadden, and leaving most of the men to cut up the heifer
      and carry the best of her meat to camp, they started on the blood spoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some hours they followed the bull, till at last they lost the trail on
      a patch of stony ground thickly covered with bush, and exhausted by the
      heat, sat down to rest and to eat some <i>biltong</i> or sun-dried flesh
      which they had with them. They finished their meal, and were preparing to
      return to the camp, when one of the four Zulus who were with them went to
      drink at a little stream that ran at a distance of not more than ten paces
      away. Half a minute later they heard a hideous grunting noise and a
      splashing of water, and saw the Zulu fly into the air. All the while that
      they were eating, the wounded buffalo had been lying in wait for them
      under a thick bush on the banks of the streamlet, knowing&mdash;cunning
      brute that he was&mdash;that sooner or later his turn would come. With a
      shout of consternation they rushed forward to see the bull vanish over the
      rise before Hadden could get a chance of firing at him, and to find their
      companion dying, for the great horn had pierced his lung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a buffalo, it is a devil,&rdquo; the poor fellow gasped, and expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Devil or not, I mean to kill it,&rdquo; exclaimed Hadden. So leaving the others
      to carry the body of their comrade to camp, he started on accompanied by
      Nahoon only. Now the ground was more open and the chase easier, for they
      sighted their quarry frequently, though they could not come near enough to
      fire. Presently they travelled down a steep cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where we are?&rdquo; asked Nahoon, pointing to a belt of forest
      opposite. &ldquo;That is <i>Emagudu</i>, the Home of the Dead&mdash;and look,
      the bull heads thither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hadden glanced round him. It was true; yonder to the left were the Fall,
      the Pool of Doom, and the hut of the Bee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;then we must head for it too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nahoon halted. &ldquo;Surely you would not enter there,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely I will,&rdquo; replied Hadden, &ldquo;but there is no need for you to do so if
      you are afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid&mdash;of ghosts,&rdquo; said the Zulu, &ldquo;but I will come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they crossed the strip of turf, and entered the haunted wood. It was a
      gloomy place indeed; the great wide-topped trees grew thick there shutting
      out the sight of the sky; moreover, the air in it which no breeze stirred,
      was heavy with the exhalations of rotting foliage. There seemed to be no
      life here and no sound&mdash;only now and again a loathsome spotted snake
      would uncoil itself and glide away, and now and again a heavy rotten bough
      fell with a crash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadden was too intent upon the buffalo, however, to be much impressed by
      his surroundings. He only remarked that the light would be bad for
      shooting, and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must have penetrated a mile or more into the forest when the sudden
      increase of blood upon the spoor told them that the bull&rsquo;s wound was
      proving fatal to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run now,&rdquo; said Hadden cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, <i>hamba gachle</i>&mdash;go softly&mdash;&rdquo; answered Nahoon, &ldquo;the
      devil is dying, but he will try to play us another trick before he dies.&rdquo;
       And he went on peering ahead of him cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all right here, anyway,&rdquo; said Hadden, pointing to the spoor that
      ran straight forward printed deep in the marshy ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nahoon did not answer, but stared steadily at the trunks of two trees a
      few paces in front of them and to their right. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadden did so, and at length made out the outline of something brown that
      was crouched behind the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Nahoon, &ldquo;he has come back on his own path and is waiting
      for us. He knows that we are following his spoor. Now if you stand there,
      I think that you can shoot him through the back between the tree trunks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hadden knelt down, and aiming very carefully at a point just below the
      bull&rsquo;s spine, he fired. There was an awful bellow, and the next instant
      the brute was up and at them. Nahoon flung his broad spear, which sank
      deep into its chest, then they fled this way and that. The buffalo stood
      still for a moment, its fore legs straddled wide and its head down,
      looking first after the one and then the other, till of a sudden it
      uttered a low moaning sound and rolled over dead, smashing Nahoon&rsquo;s
      assegai to fragments as it fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! he&rsquo;s finished,&rdquo; said Hadden, &ldquo;and I believe it was your assegai
      that killed him. Hullo! what&rsquo;s that noise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nahoon listened. In several quarters of the forest, but from how far away
      it was impossible to tell, there rose a curious sound, as of people
      calling to each other in fear but in no articulate language. Nahoon
      shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the <i>Esemkofu</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the ghosts who have no tongue, and
      who can only wail like infants. Let us be going; this place is bad for
      mortals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And worse for buffaloes,&rdquo; said Hadden, giving the dead bull a kick, &ldquo;but
      I suppose that we must leave him here for your friends, the <i>Esemkofu</i>,
      as we have got meat enough, and can&rsquo;t carry his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they started back towards the open country. As they threaded their way
      slowly through the tree trunks, a new idea came into Hadden&rsquo;s head. Once
      out of this forest, he was within an hour&rsquo;s run of the Zulu border, and
      once over the Zulu border, he would feel a happier man than he did at that
      moment. As has been said, he had intended to attempt to escape in the
      darkness, but the plan was risky. All the Zulus might not over-eat
      themselves and go to sleep, especially after the death of their comrade;
      Nahoon, who watched him day and night, certainly would not. This was his
      opportunity&mdash;there remained the question of Nahoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, if it came to the worst, Nahoon must die: it would be easy&mdash;he
      had a loaded rifle, and now that his assegai was gone, Nahoon had only a
      kerry. He did not wish to kill the man, though it was clear to him, seeing
      that his own safety was at stake, that he would be amply justified in so
      doing. Why should he not put it to him&mdash;and then be guided by
      circumstances?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nahoon was walking across a little open space about ten spaces ahead of
      him where Hadden could see him very well, whilst he himself was under the
      shadow of a large tree with low horizontal branches running out from the
      trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nahoon,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Zulu turned round, and took a step towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, do not move, I pray. Stand where you are, or I shall be obliged to
      shoot you. Listen now: do not be afraid for I shall not fire without
      warning. I am your prisoner, and you are charged to take me back to the
      king to be his servant. But I believe that a war is going to break out
      between your people and mine; and this being so, you will understand that
      I do not wish to go to Cetywayo&rsquo;s kraal, because I should either come to a
      violent death there, or my own brothers will believe that I am a traitor
      and treat me accordingly. The Zulu border is not much more than an hour&rsquo;s
      journey away&mdash;let us say an hour and a half&rsquo;s: I mean to be across it
      before the moon is up. Now, Nahoon, will you lose me in the forest and
      give me this hour and a half&rsquo;s start&mdash;or will you stop here with that
      ghost people of whom you talk? Do you understand? No, please do not move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; answered the Zulu, in a perfectly composed voice, &ldquo;and
      I think that was a good name which we gave you this morning, though, Black
      Heart, there is some justice in your words and more wisdom. Your
      opportunity is good, and one which a man named as you are should not let
      fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to find that you take this view of the matter, Nahoon. And now
      will you be so kind as to lose me, and to promise not to look for me till
      the moon is up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Black Heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say. Come, I have no time to spare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a strange man,&rdquo; said the Zulu reflectively. &ldquo;You heard the king&rsquo;s
      order to me: would you have me disobey the order of the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I would. You have no reason to love Cetywayo, and it does not
      matter to you whether or no I return to his kraal to mend guns there. If
      you think that he will be angry because I am missing, you had better cross
      the border also; we can go together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And leave my father and all my brethren to his vengeance? Black Heart,
      you do not understand. How can you, being so named? I am a soldier, and
      the king&rsquo;s word is the king&rsquo;s word. I hoped to have died fighting, but I
      am the bird in your noose. Come, shoot, or you will not reach the border
      before moonrise,&rdquo; and he opened his arms and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it must be, so let it be. Farewell, Nahoon, at least you are a brave
      man, but every one of us must cherish his own life,&rdquo; answered Hadden
      calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with much deliberation he raised his rifle and covered the Zulu&rsquo;s
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already&mdash;whilst his victim stood there still smiling, although a
      twitching of his lips betrayed the natural terrors that no bravery can
      banish&mdash;already his finger was contracting on the trigger, when of a
      sudden, as instantly as though he had been struck by lightning, Hadden
      went down backwards, and behold! there stood upon him a great spotted
      beast that waved its long tail to and fro and glared down into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a leopard&mdash;a tiger as they call it in Africa&mdash;which,
      crouched upon a bough of the tree above, had been unable to resist the
      temptation of satisfying its savage appetite on the man below. For a
      second or two there was silence, broken only by the purring, or rather the
      snoring sound made by the leopard. In those seconds, strangely enough,
      there sprang up before Hadden&rsquo;s mental vision a picture of the <i>inyanga</i>
      called <i>Inyosi</i> or the Bee, her death-like head resting against the
      thatch of the hut, and her death-like lips muttering &ldquo;think of my word
      when the great cat purrs above your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the brute put out its strength. The claws of one paw it drove deep
      into the muscles of his left thigh, while with another it scratched at his
      breast, tearing the clothes from it and furrowing the flesh beneath. The
      sight of the white skin seemed to madden it, and in its fierce desire for
      blood it drooped its square muzzle and buried its fangs in its victim&rsquo;s
      shoulder. Next moment there was a sound of running feet and of a club
      falling heavily. Up reared the leopard with an angry snarl, up till it
      stood as high as the attacking Zulu. At him it came, striking out savagely
      and tearing the black man as it had torn the white. Again the kerry fell
      full on its jaws, and down it went backwards. Before it could rise again,
      or rather as it was in the act of rising, the heavy knob-stick struck it
      once more, and with fearful force, this time as it chanced, full on the
      nape of the neck, and paralysing the brute. It writhed and bit and
      twisted, throwing up the earth and leaves, while blow after blow was
      rained upon it, till at length with a convulsive struggle and a stifled
      roar it lay still&mdash;the brains oozing from its shattered skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadden sat up, the blood running from his wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have saved my life, Nahoon,&rdquo; he said faintly, &ldquo;and I thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not thank me, Black Heart,&rdquo; answered the Zulu, &ldquo;it was the king&rsquo;s word
      that I should keep you safely. Still this tiger has been hardly dealt
      with, for certainly <i>he</i> has saved <i>my</i> life,&rdquo; and lifting the
      Martini he unloaded the rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Hadden swooned away.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Twenty-four hours had gone by when, after what seemed to him to be but a
      little time of troubled and dreamful sleep, through which he could hear
      voices without understanding what they said, and feel himself borne he
      knew not whither, Hadden awoke to find himself lying upon a kaross in a
      large and beautifully clean Kaffir hut with a bundle of furs for a pillow.
      There was a bowl of milk at his side and tortured as he was by thirst, he
      tried to stretch out his arm to lift it to his lips, only to find to his
      astonishment that his hand fell back to his side like that of a dead man.
      Looking round the hut impatiently, he found that there was nobody in it to
      assist him, so he did the only thing which remained for him to do&mdash;he
      lay still. He did not fall asleep, but his eyes closed, and a kind of
      gentle torpor crept over him, half obscuring his recovered senses.
      Presently he heard a soft voice speaking; it seemed far away, but he could
      clearly distinguish the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black Heart still sleeps,&rdquo; the voice said, &ldquo;but there is colour in his
      face; I think that he will wake soon, and find his thoughts again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear, Nanea, he will surely wake, his hurts are not dangerous,&rdquo;
       answered another voice, that of Nahoon. &ldquo;He fell heavily with the weight
      of the tiger on top of him, and that is why his senses have been shaken
      for so long. He went near to death, but certainly he will not die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been a pity if he had died,&rdquo; answered the soft voice, &ldquo;he
      is so beautiful; never have I seen a white man who was so beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not think him beautiful when he stood with his rifle pointed at my
      heart,&rdquo; answered Nahoon sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there is this to be said,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;he wished to escape from
      Cetywayo, and that is not to be wondered at,&rdquo; and she sighed. &ldquo;Moreover he
      asked you to come with him, and it might have been well if you had done
      so, that is, if you would have taken me with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I have done it, girl?&rdquo; he asked angrily. &ldquo;Would you have me set
      at nothing the order of the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The king!&rdquo; she replied raising her voice. &ldquo;What do you owe to this king?
      You have served him faithfully, and your reward is that within a few days
      he will take me from you&mdash;me, who should have been your wife, and I
      must&mdash;I must&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And she began to weep softly, adding
      between her sobs, &ldquo;if you loved me truly, you would think more of me and
      of yourself, and less of the Black One and his orders. Oh! let us fly,
      Nahoon, let us fly to Natal before this spear pierces me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weep not, Nanea,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;why do you tear my heart in two between my
      duty and my love? You know that I am a soldier, and that I must walk the
      path whereon the king has set my feet. Soon I think I shall be dead, for I
      seek death, and then it will matter nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to you, Nahoon, who are at peace, but to me? Yet, you are right,
      and I know it, therefore forgive me, who am no warrior, but a woman who
      must also obey&mdash;the will of the king.&rdquo; And she cast her arms about
      his neck, sobbing her fill upon his breast.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      NANEA
    </h3>
    <p>
      Presently, muttering something that the listener could not catch, Nahoon
      left Nanea, and crept out of the hut by its bee-hole entrance. Then Hadden
      opened his eyes and looked round him. The sun was sinking and a ray of its
      red light streaming through the little opening filled the place with a
      soft and crimson glow. In the centre of the hut&mdash;supporting it&mdash;stood
      a thorn-wood roof-tree coloured black by the smoke of the fire; and
      against this, the rich light falling full upon her, leaned the girl Nanea&mdash;a
      very picture of gentle despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      As is occasionally the case among Zulu women, she was beautiful&mdash;so
      beautiful that the sight of her went straight to the white man&rsquo;s heart,
      for a moment causing the breath to catch in his throat. Her dress was very
      simple. On her shoulders, hanging open in front, lay a mantle of soft
      white stuff edged with blue beads, about her middle was a buck-skin
      moocha, also embroidered with blue beads, while round her forehead and
      left knee were strips of grey fur, and on her right wrist a shining bangle
      of copper. Her naked bronze-hued figure was tall and perfect in its
      proportions; while her face had little in common with that of the ordinary
      native girl, showing as it did strong traces of the ancestral Arabian or
      Semitic blood. It was oval in shape, with delicate aquiline features,
      arched eyebrows, a full mouth, that drooped a little at the corners, tiny
      ears, behind which the wavy coal-black hair hung down to the shoulders,
      and the very loveliest pair of dark and liquid eyes that it is possible to
      imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute or more Nanea stood thus, her sweet face bathed in the
      sunbeam, while Hadden feasted his eyes upon its beauty. Then sighing
      heavily, she turned, and seeing that he was awake, started, drew her
      mantle over her breast and came, or rather glided, towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chief is awake,&rdquo; she said in her soft Zulu accents. &ldquo;Does he need
      aught?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Lady,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I need to drink, but alas! I am too weak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knelt down beside him, and supporting him with her left arm, with her
      right held the gourd to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      How it came about Hadden never knew, but before that draught was finished
      a change passed over him. Whether it was the savage girl&rsquo;s touch, or her
      strange and fawn-like loveliness, or the tender pity in her eyes, matters
      not&mdash;the issue was the same. She struck some cord in his turbulent
      uncurbed nature, and of a sudden it was filled full with passion for her&mdash;a
      passion which if, not elevated, at least was real. He did not for a moment
      mistake the significance of the flood of feeling that surged through his
      veins. Hadden never shirked facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Heaven!&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I have fallen in love with a black
      beauty at first sight&mdash;more in love than I have ever been before.
      It&rsquo;s awkward, but there will be compensations. So much the worse for
      Nahoon, or for Cetywayo, or for both of them. After all, I can always get
      rid of her if she becomes a nuisance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, in a fit of renewed weakness, brought about by the turmoil of his
      blood, he lay back upon the pillow of furs, watching Nanea&rsquo;s face while
      with a native salve of pounded leaves she busied herself dressing the
      wounds that the leopard had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      It almost seemed as though something of what was passing in his mind
      communicated itself to that of the girl. At least, her hand shook a little
      at her task, and getting done with it as quickly as she could, she rose
      from her knees with a courteous &ldquo;It is finished, <i>Inkoos</i>,&rdquo; and once
      more took up her position by the roof-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Lady,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;your hand is kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not call me lady, <i>Inkoos</i>,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I am no
      chieftainess, but only the daughter of a headman, Umgona.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And named Nanea,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nay, do not be surprised, I have heard of
      you. Well, Nanea, perhaps you will soon become a chieftainess&mdash;up at
      the king&rsquo;s kraal yonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! and alas!&rdquo; she said, covering her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not grieve, Nanea, a hedge is never so tall and thick but that it
      cannot be climbed or crept through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She let fall her hands and looked at him eagerly, but he did not pursue
      the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, how did I come here, Nanea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nahoon and his companions carried you, <i>Inkoos</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I begin to be thankful to the leopard that struck me down. Well,
      Nahoon is a brave man, and he has done me a great service. I trust that I
      may be able to repay it&mdash;to you, Nanea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      This was the first meeting of Nanea and Hadden; but, although she did not
      seek them, the necessities of his sickness and of the situation brought
      about many another. Never for a moment did the white man waver in his
      determination to get into his keeping the native girl who had captivated
      him, and to attain his end he brought to bear all his powers and charm to
      detach her from Nahoon, and win her affections for himself. He was no
      rough wooer, however, but proceeded warily, weaving her about with a web
      of flattery and attention that must, he thought, produce the desired
      effect upon her mind. Without a doubt, indeed, it would have done so&mdash;for
      she was but a woman, and an untutored one&mdash;had it not been for a
      simple fact which dominated her whole nature. She loved Nahoon, and there
      was no room in her heart for any other man, white or black. To Hadden she
      was courteous and kindly but no more, nor did she appear to notice any of
      the subtle advances by which he attempted to win a foothold in her heart.
      For a while this puzzled him, but he remembered that the Zulu women do not
      usually permit themselves to show feeling towards an undeclared suitor.
      Therefore it became necessary that he should speak out.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind once made up, he had not to wait long for an opportunity. He was
      now quite recovered from his hurts, and accustomed to walk in the
      neighbourhood of the kraal. About two hundred yards from Umgona&rsquo;s huts
      rose a spring, and thither it was Nanea&rsquo;s habit to resort in the evening
      to bring back drinking-water for the use of her father&rsquo;s household. The
      path between this spring and the kraal ran through a patch of bush, where
      on a certain afternoon towards sundown Hadden took his seat under a tree,
      having first seen Nanea go down to the little stream as was her custom. A
      quarter of an hour later she reappeared carrying a large gourd upon her
      head. She wore no garment now except her moocha, for she had but one
      mantle and was afraid lest the water should splash it. He watched her
      advancing along the path, her hands resting on her hips, her splendid
      naked figure outlined against the westering sun, and wondered what excuse
      he could make to talk with her. As it chanced fortune favoured him, for
      when she was near him a snake glided across the path in front of the
      girl&rsquo;s feet, causing her to spring backwards in alarm and overset the
      gourd of water. He came forward, and picked it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; he said laughing; &ldquo;I will bring it to you full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, <i>Inkoos</i>,&rdquo; she remonstrated, &ldquo;that is a woman&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among my people,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the men love to work for the women,&rdquo; and he
      started for the spring, leaving her wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he reached her again, he regretted his gallantry, for it was
      necessary to carry the handleless gourd upon his shoulder, and the
      contents of it spilling over the edge soaked him. Of this, however, he
      said nothing to Nanea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is your water, Nanea, shall I carry it for you to the kraal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, <i>Inkoos</i>, I thank you, but give it to me, you are weary with
      its weight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay awhile, and I will accompany you. Ah! Nanea, I am still weak, and
      had it not been for you I think that I should be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Nahoon who saved you&mdash;not I, <i>Inkoos</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nahoon saved my body, but you, Nanea, you alone can save my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk darkly, <i>Inkoos</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must make my meaning clear, Nanea. I love you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened her brown eyes wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, a white lord, love me, a Zulu girl? How can that be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, Nanea, but it is so, and were you not blind you would have
      seen it. I love you, and I wish to take you to wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, <i>Inkoos</i>, it is impossible. I am already betrothed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;betrothed to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, betrothed to Nahoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is the king who will take you within a week; is it not so? And
      would you not rather that I should take you than the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to be so, <i>Inkoos</i>, and I would rather go with you than
      with the king, but most of all I desire to marry Nahoon. It may be that I
      shall not be able to marry him, but if that is so, at least I will never
      become one of the king&rsquo;s women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will you prevent it, Nanea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are waters in which a maid may drown, and trees upon which she can
      hang,&rdquo; she answered with a quick setting of the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That were a pity, Nanea, you are too fair to die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair or foul, yet I die, <i>Inkoos</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, come with me&mdash;I will find a way&mdash;and be my wife,&rdquo; and
      he put her arm about her waist, and strove to draw her to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without any violence of movement, and with the most perfect dignity, the
      girl disengaged herself from his embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have honoured me, and I thank you, <i>Inkoos</i>,&rdquo; she said quietly,
      &ldquo;but you do not understand. I am the wife of Nahoon&mdash;I belong to
      Nahoon; therefore, I cannot look on any other man while Nahoon lives. It
      is not our custom, <i>Inkoos</i>, for we are not as the white women, but
      ignorant and simple, and when we vow ourselves to a man, we abide by that
      vow till death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Hadden; &ldquo;and so now you go to tell Nahoon that I have
      offered to make you my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, <i>Inkoos</i>, why should I tell Nahoon your secrets? I have said
      &lsquo;nay&rsquo; to you, not &lsquo;yea,&rsquo; therefore he has no right to know,&rdquo; and she
      stooped to lift the gourd of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadden considered the situation rapidly, for his repulse only made him the
      more determined to succeed. Of a sudden under the emergency he conceived a
      scheme, or rather its rough outline. It was not a nice scheme, and some
      men might have shrunk from it, but as he had no intention of suffering
      himself to be defeated by a Zulu girl, he decided&mdash;with regret, it is
      true&mdash;that having failed to attain his ends by means which he
      considered fair, he must resort to others of more doubtful character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nanea,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are a good and honest woman, and I respect you. As
      I have told you, I love you also, but if you refuse to listen to me there
      is nothing more to be said, and after all, perhaps it would be better that
      you should marry one of your own people. But, Nanea, you will never marry
      him, for the king will take you; and, if he does not give you to some
      other man, either you will become one of his &lsquo;sisters,&rsquo; or to be free of
      him, as you say, you will die. Now hear me, for it is because I love you
      and wish your welfare that I speak thus. Why do you not escape into Natal,
      taking Nahoon with you, for there as you know you may live in peace out of
      reach of the arm of Cetywayo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my desire, <i>Inkoos</i>, but Nahoon will not consent. He says
      that there is to be war between us and you white men, and he will not
      break the command of the king and desert from his army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he cannot love you much, Nahoon, and at least you have to think of
      yourself. Whisper into the ear of your father and fly together, for be
      sure that Nahoon will soon follow you. Ay! and I myself with fly with you,
      for I too believe that there must be war, and then a white man in this
      country will be as a lamb among the eagles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Nahoon will come, I will go, <i>Inkoos</i>, but I cannot fly without
      Nahoon; it is better I should stay here and kill myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely then being so fair and loving him so well, you can teach him to
      forget his folly and to escape with you. In four days&rsquo; time we must start
      for the king&rsquo;s kraal, and if you win over Nahoon, it will be easy for us
      to turn our faces southwards and across the river that lies between the
      land of the Amazulu and Natal. For the sake of all of us, but most of all
      for your own sake, try to do this, Nanea, whom I have loved and whom I now
      would save. See him and plead with him as you know how, but as yet do not
      tell him that I dream of flight, for then I should be watched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In truth, I will, <i>Inkoos</i>,&rdquo; she answered earnestly, &ldquo;and oh! I
      thank you for your goodness. Fear not that I will betray you&mdash;first
      would I die. Farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, Nanea,&rdquo; and taking her hand he raised it to his lips.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Late that night, just as Hadden was beginning to prepare himself for
      sleep, he heard a gentle tapping at the board which closed the entrance to
      his hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enter,&rdquo; he said, unfastening the door, and presently by the light of the
      little lantern that he had with him, he saw Nanea creep into the hut,
      followed by the great form of Nahoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Inkoos</i>,&rdquo; she said in a whisper when the door was closed again, &ldquo;I
      have pleaded with Nahoon, and he has consented to fly; moreover, my father
      will come also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it so, Nahoon?&rdquo; asked Hadden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; answered the Zulu, looking down shamefacedly; &ldquo;to save this
      girl from the king, and because the love of her eats out my heart, I have
      bartered away my honour. But I tell you, Nanea, and you, White Man, as I
      told Umgona just now, that I think no good will come of this flight, and
      if we are caught or betrayed, we shall be killed every one of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caught we can scarcely be,&rdquo; broke in Nanea anxiously, &ldquo;for who could
      betray us, except the <i>Inkoos</i> here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which he is not likely to do,&rdquo; said Hadden quietly, &ldquo;seeing that he
      desires to escape with you, and that his life is also at stake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so, Black Heart,&rdquo; said Nahoon, &ldquo;otherwise I tell you that I
      should not have trusted you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hadden took no notice of this outspoken saying, but until very late that
      night they sat there together making their plans.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      On the following morning Hadden was awakened by sounds of violent
      altercation. Going out of his hut he found that the disputants were Umgona
      and a fat and evil-looking Kaffir chief who had arrived at the kraal on a
      pony. This chief, he soon discovered, was named Maputa, being none other
      than the man who had sought Nanea in marriage and brought about Nahoon&rsquo;s
      and Umgona&rsquo;s unfortunate appeal to the king. At present he was engaged in
      abusing Umgona furiously, charging him with having stolen certain of his
      oxen and bewitched his cows so that they would not give milk. The alleged
      theft it was comparatively easy to disprove, but the wizardry remained a
      matter of argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a dog, and a son of a dog,&rdquo; shouted Maputa, shaking his fat fist
      in the face of the trembling but indignant Umgona. &ldquo;You promised me your
      daughter in marriage, then having vowed her to that <i>umfagozan</i>&mdash;that
      low lout of a soldier, Nahoon, the son of Zomba&mdash;you went, the two of
      you, and poisoned the king&rsquo;s ear against me, bringing me into trouble with
      the king, and now you have bewitched my cattle. Well, wait, I will be even
      with you, Wizard; wait till you wake up in the cold morning to find your
      fence red with fire, and the slayers standing outside your gates to eat up
      you and yours with spears&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Nahoon, who till now had been listening in silence,
      intervened with effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will wait, but not in your company, Chief Maputa. <i>Hamba!</i>
      (go)&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and seizing the fat old ruffian by the scruff of his
      neck, he flung him backwards with such violence that he rolled over and
      over down the little slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadden laughed, and passed on towards the stream where he proposed to
      bathe. Just as he reached it, he caught sight of Maputa riding along the
      footpath, his head-ring covered with mud, his lips purple and his black
      face livid with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes an angry man,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;Now, how would it be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       and he looked upwards like one seeking an inspiration. It seemed to come;
      perhaps the devil finding it open whispered in his ear, at any rate&mdash;in
      a few seconds his plan was formed, and he was walking through the bush to
      meet Maputa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go in peace, Chief,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;they seem to have treated you roughly up
      yonder. Having no power to interfere, I came away for I could not bear the
      sight. It is indeed shameful that an old and venerable man of rank should
      be struck into the dirt, and beaten by a soldier drunk with beer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shameful, White Man!&rdquo; gasped Maputa; &ldquo;your words are true indeed. But
      wait a while. I, Maputa, will roll that stone over, I will throw that bull
      upon its back. When next the harvest ripens, this I promise, that neither
      Nahoon nor Umgona, nor any of his kraal shall be left to gather it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how will you manage that, Maputa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, but I will find a way. Oh! I tell you, a way shall be
      found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hadden patted the pony&rsquo;s neck meditatively, then leaning forward, he
      looked the chief in the eyes and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you give me, Maputa, if I show you that way, a sure and certain
      one, whereby you may be avenged to the death upon Nahoon, whose violence I
      also have seen, and upon Umgona, whose witchcraft brought sore sickness
      upon me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What reward do you seek, White Man?&rdquo; asked Maputa eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little thing, Chief, a thing of no account, only the girl Nanea, to
      whom as it chances I have taken a fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted her for myself, White Man, but he who sits at Ulundi has laid
      his hand upon her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nothing, Chief; I can arrange with him who &lsquo;sits at Ulundi.&rsquo; It
      is with you who are great here that I wish to come to terms. Listen: if
      you grant my desire, not only will I fulfil yours upon your foes, but when
      the girl is delivered into my hands I will give you this rifle and a
      hundred rounds of cartridges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maputa looked at the sporting Martini, and his eyes glistened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it is very good. Often have I wished for such a
      gun that will enable me to shoot game, and to talk with my enemies from
      far away. Promise it to me, White Man, and you shall take the girl if I
      can give her to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You swear it, Maputa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it by the head of Chaka, and the spirits of my fathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. At dawn on the fourth day from now it is the purpose of Umgona, his
      daughter Nanea, and Nahoon, to cross the river into Natal by the drift
      that is called Crocodile Drift, taking their cattle with them and flying
      from the king. I also shall be of their company, for they know that I have
      learned their secret, and would murder me if I tried to leave them. Now
      you who are chief of the border and guardian of that drift, must hide at
      night with some men among the rocks in the shallows of the drift and await
      our coming. First Nanea will cross driving the cows and calves, for so it
      is arranged, and I shall help her; then will follow Umgona and Nahoon with
      the oxen and heifers. On these two you must fall, killing them and
      capturing the cattle, and afterwards I will give you the rifle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if the king should ask for the girl, White Man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you shall answer that in the uncertain light you did not recognise
      her and so she slipped away from you; moreover, that at first you feared
      to seize the girl lest her cries should alarm the men and they should
      escape you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, but how can I be sure that you will give me the gun once you are
      across the river?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus: before I enter the ford I will lay the rifle and cartridges upon a
      stone by the bank, telling Nanea that I shall return to fetch them when I
      have driven over the cattle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well, White Man; I will not fail you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the plot was made, and after some further conversation upon points of
      detail, the two conspirators shook hands and parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That ought to come off all right,&rdquo; reflected Hadden to himself as he
      plunged and floated in the waters of the stream, &ldquo;but somehow I don&rsquo;t
      quite trust our friend Maputa. It would have been better if I could have
      relied upon myself to get rid of Nahoon and his respected uncle&mdash;a
      couple of shots would do it in the water. But then that would be murder
      and murder is unpleasant; whereas the other thing is only the delivery to
      justice of two base deserters, a laudable action in a military country.
      Also personal interference upon my part might turn the girl against me;
      while after Umgona and Nahoon have been wiped out by Maputa, she <i>must</i>
      accept my escort. Of course there is a risk, but in every walk of life the
      most cautious have to take risks at times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As it chanced, Philip Hadden was correct in his suspicions of his
      coadjutor, Maputa. Even before that worthy chief reached his own kraal, he
      had come to the conclusion that the white man&rsquo;s plan, though attractive in
      some ways, was too dangerous, since it was certain that if the girl Nanea
      escaped, the king would be indignant. Moreover, the men he took with him
      to do the killing in the drift would suspect something and talk. On the
      other hand he would earn much credit with his majesty by revealing the
      plot, saying that he had learned it from the lips of the white hunter,
      whom Umgona and Nahoon had forced to participate in it, and of whose
      coveted rifle he must trust to chance to possess himself.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      An hour later two discreet messengers were bounding across the plains,
      bearing words from the Chief Maputa, the Warden of the Border, to the
      &ldquo;great Black Elephant&rdquo; at Ulundi.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE DOOM POOL
    </h3>
    <p>
      Fortune showed itself strangely favourable to the plans of Nahoon and
      Nanea. One of the Zulu captain&rsquo;s perplexities was as to how he should lull
      the suspicions and evade the vigilance of his own companions, who together
      with himself had been detailed by the king to assist Hadden in his hunting
      and to guard against his escape. As it chanced, however, on the day after
      the incident of the visit of Maputa, a messenger arrived from no less a
      person than the great military Induna, Tvingwayo ka Marolo, who afterwards
      commanded the Zulu army at Isandhlwana, ordering these men to return to
      their regiment, the Umcityu Corps, which was to be placed upon full war
      footing. Accordingly Nahoon sent them, saying that he himself would follow
      with Black Heart in the course of a few days, as at present the white man
      was not sufficiently recovered from his hurts to allow of his travelling
      fast and far. So the soldiers went, doubting nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Umgona gave it out that in obedience to the command of the king he
      was about to start for Ulundi, taking with him his daughter Nanea to be
      delivered over into the <i>Sigodhla</i>, and also those fifteen head of
      cattle that had been <i>lobola&rsquo;d</i> by Nahoon in consideration of his
      forthcoming marriage, whereof he had been fined by Cetywayo. Under
      pretence that they required a change of veldt, the rest of his cattle he
      sent away in charge of a Basuto herd who knew nothing of their plans,
      telling him to keep them by the Crocodile Drift, as there the grass was
      good and sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      All preparations being completed, on the third day the party started,
      heading straight for Ulundi. After they had travelled some miles, however,
      they left the road and turning sharp to the right, passed unobserved of
      any through a great stretch of uninhabited bush. Their path now lay not
      far from the Pool of Doom, which, indeed, was close to Umgona&rsquo;s kraal, and
      the forest that was called Home of the Dead, but out of sight of these. It
      was their plan to travel by night, reaching the broken country near the
      Crocodile Drift on the following morning. Here they proposed to lie hid
      that day and through the night; then, having first collected the cattle
      which had preceded them, to cross the river at the break of dawn and
      escape into Natal. At least this was the plan of his companions; but, as
      we know, Hadden had another programme, whereon after one last appearance
      two of the party would play no part.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that long afternoon&rsquo;s journey Umgona, who knew every inch of the
      country, walked ahead driving the fifteen cattle and carrying in his hand
      a long travelling stick of black and white <i>umzimbeet</i> wood, for in
      truth the old man was in a hurry to reach his journey&rsquo;s end. Next came
      Nahoon, armed with a broad assegai, but naked except for his moocha and
      necklet of baboon&rsquo;s teeth, and with him Nanea in her white bead-bordered
      mantle. Hadden, who brought up the rear, noticed that the girl seemed to
      be under the spell of an imminent apprehension, for from time to time she
      clasped her lover&rsquo;s arm, and looking up into his face, addressed him with
      vehemence, almost with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously enough, the sight touched Hadden, and once or twice he was
      shaken by so sharp a pang of remorse at the thought of his share in this
      tragedy, that he cast about in his mind seeking a means to unravel the web
      of death which he himself had woven. But ever that evil voice was
      whispering at his ear. It reminded him that he, the white <i>Inkoos</i>,
      had been refused by this dusky beauty, and that if he found a way to save
      him, within some few hours she would be the wife of the savage gentleman
      at her side, the man who had named him Black Heart and who despised him,
      the man whom he had meant to murder and who immediately repaid his
      treachery by rescuing him from the jaws of the leopard at the risk of his
      own life. Moreover, it was a law of Hadden&rsquo;s existence never to deny
      himself of anything that he desired if it lay within his power to take it&mdash;a
      law which had led him always deeper into sin. In other respects, indeed,
      it had not carried him far, for in the past he had not desired much, and
      he had won little; but this particular flower was to his hand, and he
      would pluck it. If Nahoon stood between him and the flower, so much the
      worse for Nahoon, and if it should wither in his grasp, so much the worse
      for the flower; it could always be thrown away. Thus it came about that,
      not for the first time in his life, Philip Hadden discarded the somewhat
      spasmodic prickings of conscience and listened to that evil whispering at
      his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half-past five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon the four refugees passed the
      stream that a mile or so down fell over the little precipice into the Doom
      Pool; and, entering a patch of thorn trees on the further side, walked
      straight into the midst of two-and-twenty soldiers, who were beguiling the
      tedium of expectancy by the taking of snuff and the smoking of <i>dakka</i>
      or native hemp. With these soldiers, seated on his pony, for he was too
      fat to walk, waited the Chief Maputa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observing that their expected guests had arrived, the men knocked out the
      <i>dakka</i> pipe, replaced the snuff boxes in the slits made in the lobes
      of their ears, and secured the four of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the meaning of this, O King&rsquo;s soldiers?&rdquo; asked Umgona in a
      quavering voice. &ldquo;We journey to the kraal of U&rsquo;Cetywayo; why do you molest
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed. Wherefore then are your faces set towards the south. Does the
      Black One live in the south? Well, you will journey to another kraal
      presently,&rdquo; answered the jovial-looking captain of the party with a
      callous laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; stammered Umgona.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will explain while you rest,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;The Chief Maputa
      yonder sent word to the Black One at Ulundi that he had learned of your
      intended flight to Natal from the lips of this white man, who had warned
      him of it. The Black One was angry, and despatched us to catch you and
      make an end of you. That is all. Come on now, quietly, and let us finish
      the matter. As the Doom Pool is near, your deaths will be easy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nahoon heard the words, and sprang straight at the throat of Hadden; but
      he did not reach it, for the soldiers pulled him down. Nanea heard them
      also, and turning, looked the traitor in the eyes; she said nothing, she
      only looked, but he could never forget that look. The white man for his
      part was filled with a fiery indignation against Maputa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wicked villain,&rdquo; he gasped, whereat the chief smiled in a sickly
      fashion, and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they were marched along the banks of the stream till they reached the
      waterfall that fell into the Pool of Doom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadden was a brave man after his fashion, but his heart quailed as he
      gazed into that abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you going to throw me in there?&rdquo; he asked of the Zulu captain in a
      thick voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, White Man?&rdquo; replied the soldier unconcernedly. &ldquo;No, our orders are
      to take you to the king, but what he will do with you I do not know. There
      is to be war between your people and ours, so perhaps he means to pound
      you into medicine for the use of the witch-doctors, or to peg you over an
      ant-heap as a warning to other white men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hadden received this information in silence, but its effect upon his brain
      was bracing, for instantly he began to search out some means of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      By now the party had halted near the two thorn trees that hung over the
      waters of the pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who dives first,&rdquo; asked the captain of the Chief Maputa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old wizard,&rdquo; he replied, nodding at Umgona; &ldquo;then his daughter after
      him, and last of all this fellow,&rdquo; and he struck Nahoon in the face with
      his open hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Wizard,&rdquo; said the captain, grasping Umgona by the arm, &ldquo;and let
      us see how you can swim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the words of doom Umgona seemed to recover his self-command, after the
      fashion of his race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No need to lead me, soldier,&rdquo; he said, shaking himself loose, &ldquo;who am old
      and ready to die.&rdquo; Then he kissed his daughter at his side, wrung Nahoon
      by the hand, and turning from Hadden with a gesture of contempt walked out
      upon the platform that joined the two thorn trunks. Here he stood for a
      moment looking at the setting sun, then suddenly, and without a sound, he
      hurled himself into the abyss below and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a brave one,&rdquo; said the captain with admiration. &ldquo;Can you spring
      too, girl, or must we throw you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can walk my father&rsquo;s path,&rdquo; Nanea answered faintly, &ldquo;but first I crave
      leave to say one word. It is true that we were escaping from the king, and
      therefore by the law we must die; but it was Black Heart here who made the
      plot, and he who has betrayed us. Would you know why he has betrayed us?
      Because he sought my favour, and I refused him, and this is the vengeance
      that he takes&mdash;a white man&rsquo;s vengeance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Wow!</i>&rdquo; broke in the chief Maputa, &ldquo;this pretty one speaks truth,
      for the white man would have made a bargain with me under which Umgona,
      the wizard, and Nahoon, the soldier, were to be killed at the Crocodile
      Drift, and he himself suffered to escape with the girl. I spoke him softly
      and said &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; and then like a loyal man I reported to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear,&rdquo; sighed Nanea. &ldquo;Nahoon, fare you well, though presently perhaps
      we shall be together again. It was I who tempted you from your duty. For
      my sake you forgot your honour, and I am repaid. Farewell, my husband, it
      is better to die with you than to enter the house of the king&rsquo;s women,&rdquo;
       and Nanea stepped on to the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, holding to a bough of one of the thorn trees, she turned and
      addressed Hadden, saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black Heart, you seem to have won the day, but me at least you lose and&mdash;the
      sun is not yet set. After sunset comes the night, Black Heart, and in that
      night I pray that you may wander eternally, and be given to drink of my
      blood and the blood of Umgona my father, and the blood of Nahoon my
      husband, who saved your life, and whom you have murdered. Perchance, Black
      Heart, we may yet meet yonder&mdash;in the House of the Dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then uttering a low cry Nanea clasped her hands and sprang upwards and
      outwards from the platform. The watchers bent their heads forward to look.
      They saw her rush headlong down the face of the fall to strike the water
      fifty feet below. A few seconds, and for the last time, they caught sight
      of her white garment glimmering on the surface of the gloomy pool. Then
      the shadows and mist-wreaths hid it, and she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, husband,&rdquo; cried the cheerful voice of the captain, &ldquo;yonder is your
      marriage bed, so be swift to follow a bride who is so ready to lead the
      way. <i>Wow!</i> but you are good people to kill; never have I had to do
      with any who gave less trouble. You&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and he stopped, for
      mental agony had done its work, and suddenly Nahoon went mad before his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a roar like that of a lion the great man cast off those who held him
      and seizing one of them round the waist and thigh, he put out all his
      terrible strength. Lifting him as though he had been an infant, he hurled
      him over the edge of the cliff to find his death on the rocks of the Pool
      of Doom. Then crying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black Heart! your turn, Black Heart the traitor!&rdquo; he rushed at Hadden,
      his eyes rolling and foam flying from his lips, as he passed striking the
      chief Maputa from his horse with a backward blow of his hand. Ill would it
      have gone with the white man if Nahoon had caught him. But he could not
      come at him, for the soldiers sprang upon him and notwithstanding his
      fearful struggles they pulled him to the ground, as at certain festivals
      the Zulu regiments with their naked hands pull down a bull in the presence
      of the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cast him over before he can work more mischief,&rdquo; said a voice. But the
      captain cried out, &ldquo;Nay, nay, he is sacred; the fire from Heaven has
      fallen on his brain, and we may not harm him, else evil would overtake us
      all. Bind him hand and foot, and bear him tenderly to where he can be
      cared for. Surely I thought that these evil-doers were giving us too
      little trouble, and thus it has proved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they set themselves to make fast Nahoon&rsquo;s hands and wrists, using as
      much gentleness as they might, for among the Zulus a lunatic is accounted
      holy. It was no easy task, and it took time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadden glanced around him, and saw his opportunity. On the ground close
      beside him lay his rifle, where one of the soldiers had placed it, and
      about a dozen yards away Maputa&rsquo;s pony was grazing. With a swift movement,
      he seized the Martini and five seconds later he was on the back of the
      pony, heading for the Crocodile Drift at a gallop. So quickly indeed did
      he execute this masterly retreat, that occupied as they all were in
      binding Nahoon, for half a minute or more none of the soldiers noticed
      what had happened. Then Maputa chanced to see, and waddled after him to
      the top of the rise, screaming:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The white thief, he has stolen my horse, and the gun too, the gun that he
      promised to give me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hadden, who by this time was a hundred yards away, heard him clearly, and
      a rage filled his heart. This man had made an open murderer of him; more,
      he had been the means of robbing him of the girl for whose sake he had
      dipped his hands in these iniquities. He glanced over his shoulder; Maputa
      was still running, and alone. Yes, there was time; at any rate he would
      risk it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulling up the pony with a jerk, he leapt from its back, slipping his arm
      through the rein with an almost simultaneous movement. As it chanced, and
      as he had hoped would be the case, the animal was a trained shooting
      horse, and stood still. Hadden planted his feet firmly on the ground and
      drawing a deep breath, he cocked the rifle and covered the advancing
      chief. Now Maputa saw his purpose and with a yell of terror turned to fly.
      Hadden waited a second to get the sight fair on his broad back, then just
      as the soldiers appeared above the rise he pressed the trigger. He was a
      noted shot, and in this instance his skill did not fail him; for, before
      he heard the bullet tell, Maputa flung his arms wide and plunged to the
      ground dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three seconds more, and with a savage curse, Hadden had remounted the pony
      and was riding for his life towards the river, which a while later he
      crossed in safety.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE GHOST OF THE DEAD
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Nanea leapt from the dizzy platform that overhung the Pool of Doom, a
      strange fortune befell her. Close in to the precipice were many jagged
      rocks, and on these the waters of the fall fell and thundered, bounding
      from them in spouts of spray into the troubled depths of the foss beyond.
      It was on these stones that the life was dashed out from the bodies of the
      wretched victims who were hurled from above. But Nanea, it will be
      remembered, had not waited to be treated thus, and as it chanced the
      strong spring with which she had leapt to death carried her clear of the
      rocks. By a very little she missed the edge of them and striking the deep
      water head first like some practised diver, she sank down and down till
      she thought that she would never rise again. Yet she did rise, at the end
      of the pool in the mouth of the rapid, along which she sped swiftly,
      carried down by the rush of the water. Fortunately there were no rocks
      here; and, since she was a skilful swimmer, she escaped the danger of
      being thrown against the banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long distance she was borne thus till at length she saw that she was
      in a forest, for trees cut off the light from the water, and their
      drooping branches swept its surface. One of these Nanea caught with her
      hand, and by the help of it she dragged herself from the River of Death
      whence none had escaped before. Now she stood upon the bank gasping but
      quite unharmed; there was not a scratch on her body; even her white
      garment was still fast about her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though she had suffered no hurt in her terrible voyage, so exhausted
      was Nanea that she could scarcely stand. Here the gloom was that of night,
      and shivering with cold she looked helplessly to find some refuge. Close
      to the water&rsquo;s edge grew an enormous yellow-wood tree, and to this she
      staggered&mdash;thinking to climb it, and seek shelter in its boughs
      where, as she hoped, she would be safe from wild beasts. Again fortune
      befriended her, for at a distance of a few feet from the ground there was
      a great hole in the tree which, she discovered, was hollow. Into this hole
      she crept, taking her chance of its being the home of snakes or other evil
      creatures, to find that the interior was wide and warm. It was dry also,
      for at the bottom of the cavity lay a foot or more of rotten tinder and
      moss brought there by rats or birds. Upon this tinder she lay down, and
      covering herself with the moss and leaves soon sank into sleep or stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long Nanea slept she did not know, but at length she was awakened by a
      sound as of guttural human voices talking in a language that she could not
      understand. Rising to her knees she peered out of the hole in the tree. It
      was night, but the stars shone brilliantly, and their light fell upon an
      open circle of ground close by the edge of the river. In this circle there
      burned a great fire, and at a little distance from the fire were gathered
      eight or ten horrible-looking beings, who appeared to be rejoicing over
      something that lay upon the ground. They were small in stature, men and
      women together, but no children, and all of them were nearly naked. Their
      hair was long and thin, growing down almost to the eyes, their jaws and
      teeth protruded and the girth of their black bodies was out of all
      proportion to their height. In their hands they held sticks with sharp
      stones lashed on to them, or rude hatchet-like knives of the same
      material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Nanea&rsquo;s heart shrank within her, and she nearly fainted with fear, for
      she knew that she was in the haunted forest, and without a doubt these
      were the <i>Esemkofu</i>, the evil ghosts that dwelt therein. Yes, that
      was what they were, and yet she could not take her eyes off them&mdash;the
      sight of them held her with a horrible fascination. But if they were
      ghosts, why did they sing and dance like men? Why did they wave those
      sharp stones aloft, and quarrel and strike each other? And why did they
      make a fire as men do when they wish to cook food? More, what was it that
      they rejoiced over, that long dark thing which lay so quiet upon the
      ground? It did not look like a head of game, and it could scarcely be a
      crocodile, yet clearly it was food of some sort, for they were sharpening
      the stone knives in order to cut it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she wondered thus, one of the dreadful-looking little creatures
      advanced to the fire, and taking from it a burning bough, held it over the
      thing that lay upon the ground, to give light to a companion who was about
      to do something to it with the stone knife. Next instant Nanea drew back
      her head from the hole, a stifled shriek upon her lips. She saw what it
      was now&mdash;it was the body of a man. Yes, and these were no ghosts;
      they were cannibals of whom when she was little, her mother had told her
      tales to keep her from wandering away from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But who was the man they were about to eat? It could not be one of
      themselves, for his stature was much greater. Oh! now she knew; it must be
      Nahoon, who had been killed up yonder, and whose dead body the waters had
      brought down to the haunted forest as they had brought her alive. Yes, it
      must be Nahoon, and she would be forced to see her husband devoured before
      her eyes. The thought of it overwhelmed her. That he should die by order
      of the king was natural, but that he should be buried thus! Yet what could
      she do to prevent it? Well, if it cost her her life, it should be
      prevented. At the worst they could only kill and eat her also, and now
      that Nahoon and her father were gone, being untroubled by any religious or
      spiritual hopes and fears, she was not greatly concerned to keep her own
      breath in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slipping through the hole in the tree, Nanea walked quietly towards the
      cannibals&mdash;not knowing in the least what she should do when she
      reached them. As she arrived in line with the fire this lack of programme
      came home to her mind forcibly, and she paused to reflect. Just then one
      of the cannibals looked up to see a tall and stately figure wrapped in a
      white garment which, as the flame-light flickered on it, seemed now to
      advance from the dense background of shadow, and now to recede into it.
      The poor savage wretch was holding a stone knife in his teeth when he
      beheld her, but it did not remain there long, for opening his great jaws
      he uttered the most terrified and piercing yell that Nanea had ever heard.
      Then the others saw her also, and presently the forest was ringing with
      shrieks of fear. For a few seconds the outcasts stood and gazed, then they
      were gone this way and that, bursting their path through the undergrowth
      like startled jackals. The <i>Esemkofu</i> of Zulu tradition had been
      routed in their own haunted home by what they took to be a spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor <i>Esemkofu!</i> they were but miserable and starving bushmen who,
      driven into that place of ill omen many years ago, had adopted this means,
      the only one open to them, to keep the life in their wretched bodies. Here
      at least they were unmolested, and as there was little other food to be
      found amid that wilderness of trees, they took what the river brought
      them. When executions were few in the Pool of Doom, times were hard for
      them indeed&mdash;for then they were driven to eat each other. That is why
      there were no children.
    </p>
    <p>
      As their inarticulate outcry died away in the distance, Nanea ran forward
      to look at the body that lay on the ground, and staggered back with a sigh
      of relief. It was not Nahoon, but she recognised the face for that of one
      of the party of executioners. How did he come here? Had Nahoon killed him?
      Had Nahoon escaped? She could not tell, and at the best it was improbable,
      but still the sight of this dead soldier lit her heart with a faint ray of
      hope, for how did he come to be dead if Nahoon had no hand in his death?
      She could not bear to leave him lying so near her hiding-place, however;
      therefore, with no small toil, she rolled the corpse back into the water,
      which carried it swiftly away. Then she returned to the tree, having first
      replenished the fire, and awaited the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last it came&mdash;so much of it as ever penetrated this darksome den&mdash;and
      Nanea, becoming aware that she was hungry, descended from the tree to
      search for food. All day long she searched, finding nothing, till towards
      sunset she remembered that on the outskirts of the forest there was a flat
      rock where it was the custom of those who had been in any way afflicted,
      or who considered themselves or their belongings to be bewitched, to place
      propitiatory offerings of food wherewith the <i>Esemkofu</i> and <i>Amalhosi</i>
      were supposed to satisfy their spiritual cravings. Urged by the pinch of
      starvation, to this spot Nanea journeyed rapidly, and found to her joy
      that some neighbouring kraal had evidently been in recent trouble, for the
      Rock of Offering was laden with cobs of corn, gourds of milk, porridge and
      even meat. Helping herself to as much as she could carry, she returned to
      her lair, where she drank of the milk and cooked meat and mealies at the
      fire. Then she crept back into the tree, and slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      For nearly two months Nanea lived thus in the forest, since she could not
      venture out of it&mdash;fearing lest she should be seized, and for a
      second time taste of the judgment of the king. In the forest at least she
      was safe, for none dared enter there, nor did the <i>Esemkofu</i> give her
      further trouble. Once or twice she saw them, but on each occasion they
      fled from her presence&mdash;seeking some distant retreat, where they hid
      themselves or perished. Nor did food fail her, for finding that it was
      taken, the pious givers brought it in plenty to the Rock of Offering.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, oh! the life was dreadful, and the gloom and loneliness coupled with
      her sorrows at times drove her almost to insanity. Still she lived on,
      though often she desired to die, for if her father was dead, the corpse
      she had found was not the corpse of Nahoon, and in her heart there still
      shone that spark of home. Yet what she hoped for she could not tell.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When Philip Hadden reached civilised regions, he found that war was about
      to be declared between the Queen and Cetywayo, King of the Amazulu; also
      that in the prevailing excitement his little adventure with the Utrecht
      store-keeper had been overlooked or forgotten. He was the owner of two
      good buck-waggons with spans of salted oxen, and at that time vehicles
      were much in request to carry military stores for the columns which were
      to advance into Zululand; indeed the transport authorities were glad to
      pay £90 a month for the hire of each waggon and to guarantee the owners
      against all loss of cattle. Although he was not desirous of returning to
      Zululand, this bait proved too much for Hadden, who accordingly leased out
      his waggons to the Commissariat, together with his own services as
      conductor and interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was attached to No. 3 column of the invading force, which it may be
      remembered was under the immediate command of Lord Chelmsford, and on the
      20th of January, 1879, he marched with it by the road that runs from
      Rorke&rsquo;s Drift to the Indeni forest, and encamped that night beneath the
      shadow of the steep and desolate mountain known as Isandhlwana.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day also a great army of King Cetywayo&rsquo;s, numbering twenty thousand
      men and more, moved down from the Upindo Hill and camped upon the stony
      plain that lies a mile and a half to the east of Isandhlwana. No fires
      were lit, and it lay there in utter silence, for the warriors were
      &ldquo;sleeping on their spears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that <i>impi</i> was the Umcityu regiment, three thousand five
      hundred strong. At the first break of dawn the Induna in command of the
      Umcityu looked up from beneath the shelter of the black shield with which
      he had covered his body, and through the thick mist he saw a great man
      standing before him, clothed only in a moocha, a gaunt wild-eyed man who
      held a rough club in his hand. When he was spoken to, the man made no
      answer; he only leaned upon his club looking from left to right along the
      dense array of innumerable shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this <i>Silwana</i> (wild creature)?&rdquo; asked the Induna of his
      captains wondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captains stared at the wanderer, and one of them replied, &ldquo;This is
      Nahoon-ka-Zomba, it is the son of Zomba who not long ago held rank in this
      regiment of the Umcityu. His betrothed, Nanea, daughter of Umgona, was
      killed together with her father by order of the Black One, and Nahoon went
      mad with grief at the sight of it, for the fire of Heaven entered his
      brain, and mad he has wandered ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you here, Nahoon-ka-Zomba?&rdquo; asked the Induna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Nahoon spoke slowly. &ldquo;My regiment goes down to war against the white
      men; give me a shield and a spear, O Captain of the king, that I may fight
      with my regiment, for I seek a face in the battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they gave him a shield and a spear, for they dared not turn away one
      whose brain was alight with the fire of Heaven.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      When the sun was high that day, bullets began to fall among the ranks of
      the Umcityu. Then the black-shielded, black-plumed Umcityu arose, company
      by company, and after them arose the whole vast Zulu army, breast and
      horns together, and swept down in silence upon the doomed British camp, a
      moving sheen of spears. The bullets pattered on the shields, the shells
      tore long lines through their array, but they never halted or wavered.
      Forward on either side shot out the horns of armed men, clasping the camp
      in an embrace of steel. Then as these began to close, out burst the war
      cry of the Zulus, and with the roar of a torrent and the rush of a storm,
      with a sound like the humming of a billion bees, wave after wave the deep
      breast of the <i>impi</i> rolled down upon the white men. With it went the
      black-shielded Umcityu and with them went Nahoon, the son of Zomba. A
      bullet struck him in the side, glancing from his ribs, he did not heed; a
      white man fell from his horse before him, he did not stab, for he sought
      but one face in the battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought&mdash;and at last he found. There, among the waggons where the
      spears were busiest, there standing by his horse and firing rapidly was
      Black Heart, he who had given Nanea his betrothed to death. Three soldiers
      stood between them, one of them Nahoon stabbed, and two he brushed aside;
      then he rushed straight at Hadden.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the white man saw him come, and even through the mask of his madness
      he knew Nahoon again, and terror took hold of him. Throwing away his empty
      rifle, for his ammunition was spent, he leaped upon his horse and drove
      his spurs into its flanks. Away it went among the carnage, springing over
      the dead and bursting through the lines of shields, and after it came
      Nahoon, running long and low with head stretched forward and trailing
      spear, running as a hound runs when the buck is at view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hadden&rsquo;s first plan was to head for Rorke&rsquo;s Drift, but a glance to the
      left showed him that the masses of the Undi barred that way, so he fled
      straight on, leaving his path to fortune. In five minutes he was over a
      ridge, and there was nothing of the battle to be seen, in ten all sounds
      of it had died away, for few guns were fired in the dread race to
      Fugitive&rsquo;s Drift, and the assegai makes no noise. In some strange fashion,
      even at this moment, the contrast between the dreadful scene of blood and
      turmoil that he had left, and the peaceful face of Nature over which he
      was passing, came home to his brain vividly. Here birds sang and cattle
      grazed; here the sun shone undimmed by the smoke of cannon, only high up
      in the blue and silent air long streams of vultures could be seen winging
      their way to the Plain of Isandhlwana.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground was very rough, and Hadden&rsquo;s horse began to tire. He looked
      over his shoulder&mdash;there some two hundred yards behind came the Zulu,
      grim as Death, unswerving as Fate. He examined the pistol in his belt;
      there was but one undischarged cartridge left, all the rest had been fired
      and the pouch was empty. Well, one bullet should be enough for one savage:
      the question was should he stop and use it now? No, he might miss or fail
      to kill the man; he was on horseback and his foe on foot, surely he could
      tire him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      A while passed, and they dashed through a little stream. It seemed
      familiar to Hadden. Yes, that was the pool where he used to bathe when he
      was the guest of Umgona, the father of Nanea; and there on the knoll to
      his right were the huts, or rather the remains of them, for they had been
      burnt with fire. What chance had brought him to this place, he wondered;
      then again he looked behind him at Nahoon, who seemed to read his
      thoughts, for he shook his spear and pointed to the ruined kraal.
    </p>
    <p>
      On he went at speed for here the land was level, and to his joy he lost
      sight of his pursuer. But presently there came a mile of rocky ground, and
      when it was past, glancing back he saw that Nahoon was once more in his
      old place. His horse&rsquo;s strength was almost spent, but Hadden spurred it
      forward blindly, whither he knew not. Now he was travelling along a strip
      of turf and ahead of him he heard the music of a river, while to his left
      rose a high bank. Presently the turf bent inwards and there, not twenty
      yards away from him, was a Kaffir hut standing on the brink of a river. He
      looked at it, yes, it was the hut of that accursed <i>inyanga</i>, the
      Bee, and standing by the fence of it was none other than the Bee herself.
      At the sight of her the exhausted horse swerved violently, stumbled and
      came to the ground, where it lay panting. Hadden was thrown from the
      saddle but sprang to his feet unhurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Black Heart, is it you? What news of the battle, Black Heart?&rdquo; cried
      the Bee in a mocking voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help me, mother, I am pursued,&rdquo; he gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of it, Black Heart, it is but by one tired man. Stand then and face
      him, for now Black Heart and White Heart are together again. You will not?
      Then away to the forest and seek shelter among the dead who await you
      there. Tell me, tell me, was it the face of Nanea that I saw beneath the
      waters a while ago? Good! bear my greetings to her when you two meet in
      the House of the Dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hadden looked at the stream; it was in flood. He could not swim it, so
      followed by the evil laugh of the prophetess, he sped towards the forest.
      After him came Nahoon, his tongue hanging from his jaws like the tongue of
      a wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he was in the shadow of the forest, but still he sped on following the
      course of the river, till at length his breath failed, and he halted on
      the further side of a little glade, beyond which a great tree grew. Nahoon
      was more than a spear&rsquo;s throw behind him; therefore he had time to draw
      his pistol and make ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt, Nahoon,&rdquo; he cried, as once before he had cried; &ldquo;I would speak with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Zulu heard his voice, and obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Hadden. &ldquo;We have run a long race and fought a long fight,
      you and I, and we are still alive both of us. Very soon, if you come on,
      one of us must be dead, and it will be you, Nahoon, for I am armed and as
      you know I can shoot straight. What do you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nahoon made no answer, but stood still at the edge of the glade, his wild
      and glowering eyes fixed on the white man&rsquo;s face and his breath coming in
      short gasps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you let me go, if <i>I</i> let <i>you</i> go?&rdquo; Hadden asked once
      more. &ldquo;I know why you hate me, but the past cannot be undone, nor can the
      dead be brought to earth again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Nahoon made no answer, and his silence seemed more fateful and more
      crushing than any speech; no spoken accusation would have been so terrible
      in Hadden&rsquo;s ear. He made no answer, but lifting his assegai he stalked
      grimly toward his foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was within five paces Hadden covered him and fired. Nahoon sprang
      aside, but the bullet struck him somewhere, for his right arm dropped, and
      the stabbing spear that he held was jerked from it harmlessly over the
      white man&rsquo;s head. But still making no sound, the Zulu came on and gripped
      him by the throat with his left hand. For a space they struggled terribly,
      swaying to and fro, but Hadden was unhurt and fought with the fury of
      despair, while Nahoon had been twice wounded, and there remained to him
      but one sound arm wherewith to strike. Presently forced to earth by the
      white man&rsquo;s iron strength, the soldier was down, nor could he rise again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we will make an end,&rdquo; muttered Hadden savagely, and he turned to seek
      the assegai, then staggered slowly back with starting eyes and reeling
      gait. For there before him, still clad in her white robe, a spear in her
      hand, stood the spirit of Nanea!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of it,&rdquo; he said to himself, dimly remembering the words of the <i>inyanga</i>,
      &ldquo;when you stand face to face with the ghost of the dead in the Home of the
      Dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a cry and a flash of steel; the broad spear leapt towards him to
      bury itself in his breast. He swayed, he fell, and presently Black Heart
      clasped that great reward which the word of the Bee had promised Him.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nahoon! Nahoon!&rdquo; murmured a soft voice, &ldquo;awake, it is no ghost, but I&mdash;Nanea&mdash;I,
      your living wife, to whom my <i>Ehlose</i>[*] has given it me to save
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     [*] Guardian Spirit.
</pre>
    <p>
      Nahoon heard and opened his eyes to look and his madness left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome, wife,&rdquo; he said faintly, &ldquo;now I will live since Death has brought
      you back to me in the House of the Dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      To-day Nahoon is one of the Indunas of the English Government in Zululand,
      and there are children about his kraal. It was from the lips of none other
      than Nanea his wife that the teller of this tale heard its substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bee also lives and practises as much magic as she dares under the
      white man&rsquo;s rule. On her black hand shines a golden ring shaped like a
      snake with ruby eyes, and of this trinket the Bee is very proud.
    </p>
    <p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
